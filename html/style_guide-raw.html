<h3>Dictionary Entry Components</h3>
<p>
  Dictionary <strong>headwords</strong> can be words or multi-word expressions.
  A headword is created by adding one or more entries to the words.txt file.
  The chinesenotes software will group together multiple lexical units with the
  same simplified and traditional Chinese text into the same headword.
  If the term is very specific to a single organization then it should be added
  in a file or its own. An example of this is the 
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/fgs_mwe.txt"
  >fgs_mwe.txt</a> used for Fo Guang Shan specific terms.
</p>
<p>
  Word id: Each lexical unit has a unique id. These are assigned in numeric
  sequence.
</p>
<p>
  Simplified Chinese: This field is compulsory. If the simplified Chinese text
  is the same as the traditional Chinese then add it here and leave the
  traditional Chinese field blank.
</p>
<p>
  Traditional Chinese: This field is only added if the traditional Chinese
  text is different from the simplified Chinese.
</p>
<p>
  Pinyin: This field is mandatory. Add the pinyin text with the proper 
  diacritics to indicate tone. For example, 凤梨 fènglí. Use the 
  <a href="pinyin_format.php">Format Pinyin tool</a> to add the diacritics.
</p>
<p>
  Grammar: This field is mandatory. Use one of the values in 
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/data/grammar.txt"
  >grammar.txt</a>.
</p>
<p>
  English: This field is mandatory. It should contain direct translations
  or near synonyms in English delimited by '/.' Commas, periods, and other 
  punctuation other than double quotes can be include. Do not use plain ASCII
  double quotes ". If you have to use double quotes, use a Unicode stylized
  double quote like “”.
</p>
<p>
  Concept: This is an optional field. It indicates what kind of thing a word
  refers to. For example, for 凤梨 'pineapple' the concept is (水果, Fruit).
  If you enter a value for concept you must add simplified Chinese and
  English values. There is no fixed list of concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Domain Labels: This field is mandatory. 
  Domain labels indicate specialized fields that words are used in, such as
  lingustics or medicine. In this dictionary domain labels are critical for
  separating modern Chinese, literary Chinese, and Buddhist vocabulary.
  Other values are helpful for dictionary users.
  For example, the entry for 凤梨 'pineapple' the domain
  is (饮食, Food and Drink).
  The topic_cn and topic_en fields in Chinese and English respecitvely are used
  for this purpose.
  The values must be chosen from the list
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/data/topics.txt"
  >topics.txt</a>.
  The parent_cn and parent_en are subdomains, which are optional. 
  For example, History | China, 
  i.e. Chinese History as a subdomain of the domain History.
  There is no fixed list for subdomains. They can have any value but, if a value
  is provided, then both Simplified Chinese and English should be provided.
</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
  Try to provide some notes to allow users to find out more about a word.
  The notes section provides additional information about the word. 
  For modern Chinese words notes explaining the use of the word should be given
  and examples included. Examples should illustrate the word sense with 
  English gloss of Chinese examples. English gloss is given in single quotes
  The source of the example given in English or pinyin and Chinese.
  For example, 㣇：脩豪獸。 'Yì: a grand beast with long hair.' (Shuo Wen Jie Zi,
  Scroll 10 《說文解字‧卷十》)
  Examples should be taken from the corpus.
  Synonyms in the source language should be provided to illustrate the word
  sense.
  Synonyms should exist in the dictionary. If the synonym does not exist then
  add it.
  Citations are important. Citations should be to an items listed in the 
  <a href="references.html">References</a> page.
