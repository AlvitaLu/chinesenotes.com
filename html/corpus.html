<h2>Digital Library and Corpus Management System</h2>
<p>
  The web site includes a corpus of over 39 million characters with over
  60 document sets of interesting, historically important, and largely untranslated
  Chinese texts, as listed on the <a href="/texts.html">Texts</a> page. The 
  collection of texts include the 十三經 Thirteen Classics, the 二十四史
  Twenty-Four Standard Histories, and anthologies of poetry. A relatively small
  number of bilingual Chinese-English parallel texts are included. 
  The search function on the main page will search titles of books and chapters
  for the texts in the digital library collection.
  This is an active area of expansion towards a more fully functioning digital
  library of literary Chinese.

  The Chinese Notes software and dictionary is a platform that can be to create 
  readers for multiple corpora. Besides the largely literary Chinese corpus
  at this site, the software and dictionary are also used at <a
  href="http://ntireader.org/">ntireader.org</a> for a reader for the
  Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō version of the Chinese Buddhist canon and at <a
  href="http://hbreader.org/">hbreader.org</a> for a reader for
  Venerable Master Hsing Yun's collected writings. It is a simple system
  that any web developer can use to create a Chinese web reader from a set
  of plain text files. See the <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com">GitHub project</a> for 
  more details.
