  The Chinese Notes software and dictionary is a platform that can be to create 
  readers for multiple corpora. It is currently used at <a
  href="http://ntireader.org/">ntireader.org</a> for a reader for the
  Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō version of the Chinese Buddhist canon and at <a
  href="http://hbreader.org/">hbreader.org</a> for a reader for
  Venerable Master Hsing Yun's collected writings. It is a simple system
  that any web developer can use to create a Chinese web reader from a set
  of plain text files. See the <a
  href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com">GitHub project</a> for 
  more details.
