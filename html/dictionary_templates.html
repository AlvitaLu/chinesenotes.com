<h2>Dictionary Entry Templates</h2>
<p>
  This page explains information to include in common types of entries.
  All the Chinese dictionary metadata should be entered in simplified, except
  when quoting literary Chinese sources, due to the predominant use of 
  traditional Chinese in literary Chinese texts. 
</p>
<p>
  Entries of similar types should be treat consistently. Similar types can be
  identified through similar Concept field values. Some examples are given here.
</p>
<h3>Verb</h3>
<p>
  The Notes field should explain the number and use of the arguments and give
  a simple example that illustrates use of typical arguments. It should include
  a comment on the relation or absense of a subject.
</p>
<h3>Writer</h3>
<p>
  The Concept field values are (作家, Writer). The Domain field value will most
  likely be (文学, Literature). The Subdomain field will typically be the country
  that they are from. For example, (中国, China). The Notes field should start
  with their year of birth and death. Only give the years of birth and death, 
  not months and days. Use a referable source, like Idema and Haft
  and check against other sources, such as Wikipedia and Baidu Baike. Make a
  one or two sentence note about their contribution and their style in English
  and Chinese. Cite one or two of their works in English and Chinese.
  The value of the Grammar field should be proper poun. 
  Example: 叶圣陶 Ye Shengtao.

<h3>Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>
  A word used in literary Chinese with a definition that goes back to
  pre-modern times, usually classical or pre-classical times but may include
  medieval. The term literary Chinese refers to the language and classical
  Chinese to a period. However, there are no categories in the dictionary
  for pre-classical or post-classical. The way to differentiate a classical
  Chinese entry from a modern entry is via the topic_cn and topic_en fields. The
  classical definition will have topic_en: Classical Chinese. Modern Chinese
  will have a more specific topic.
</p>
<p>
  Example: 6988 虍<br/>
  Set these fields<br/>
  grammar: noun<br/>
  concept_cn: Try to use a classical term, if possible. For example, use 
  兽 instead of 动物.<br/>
  concept_en: Add to match concept_cn<br/>
  topic_cn: 古文<br/>
  topic_en: Classical Chinese<br/>
  notes: Try to find the definition from one of the historic dictionaries or an
  example from a literary Chinese source and reference it.
  Try to find a modern Chinese synonymn. If neither of these can be found, look
  for the definition in Giles. (Giles, 1892)
