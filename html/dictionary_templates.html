<h2>Dictionary Entry Templates</h2>
<p>
  This page explains information to include in common types of entries.
  All the Chinese dictionary metadata should be entered in simplified, except
  when quoting literary Chinese sources, due to the predominant use of 
  traditional Chinese in literary Chinese texts. 
</p>
<h3>Classical Chinese</h3>
<p>
  A word used in literary Chinese with a definition that goes back to
  pre-modern times, usually classical or pre-classical times but may include
  medieval. The term literary Chinese refers to the language and classical
  Chinese to a period. However, there are no categories in the dictionary
  for pre-classical or medieval. The way to differentiate a classical Chinese
  entry from a modern entry is via the topic_cn and topic_en fields. The
  classical definition will have topic_en: Classical Chinese. Modern Chinese
  will have a more specific topic.
</p>
<p>
  Example: 6988 虍<br/>
  Set these fields<br/>
  grammar: noun<br/>
  concept_cn: Try to use a classical term, if possible. For example, use 
  兽 instead of 动物.<br/>
  concept_en: Add to match concept_cn<br/>
  topic_cn: 古文<br/>
  topic_en: Classical Chinese<br/>
  notes: Try to find the definition from one of the historic dictionaries or an
  example from a literary Chinese source and reference it.
  Try to find a modern Chinese synonymn. If neither of these can be found, look
  for the definition in Giles. (Giles, 1892)
