        The children at One Heart Children's Home recite these words of thanks together before each of their three daily meals to encourage each other and be thankful for their blessings and the kindness of others. It was written by the founder of the Children's Home.

Words of Thanks
I will join forces with others and work with a common purpose, using tolerance and empathy, to be of service to others and create a safe and peaceful home for all.

I will be greatful for my good fortune. I will be thankful for all the people that have helped me succeed and give all my blessings to them.

I will treasure connections that I make with other people. I will be greatful for the food that I have. I will treasure all the fate that comes to me and make friends all round.

With compassion, I will do good deeds. With a soft heart I will face all people, conditions, and things and bring joy to all the people around me.
