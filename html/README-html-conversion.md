#Source Files for HTML Conversion - README

This directory is for source files containing content for Chinese Notes. The
files are written as HTML fragments, excluding the header and footer markup.
The final HTML files are generated using the cnreader.go command line utility.
An entry for each file is included in $CN_HOME/data/corpus/html-conversion.csv.
The Go HTML templates are in the $CN_HOME/data/templates directory.
