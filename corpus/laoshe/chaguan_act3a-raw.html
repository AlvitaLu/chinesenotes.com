      王小花：
      妈，晌午给我作点热汤面吧！好多天没吃过啦！
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Xiaohua:
      Mom, please make me some hot noodle soup for lunch.
      I haven't eaten any for ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      周秀花：
      我知道，乖！可谁知道买得着面买不着呢！就是粮食店里可巧有面，谁知道咱们有钱没有呢！唉！
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhou Xiuhua:
      I know, dear.
      But I don't know if we will be able to buy any flour.
      Even if the grain shop by coincidence has some flour, who knows if we will have any money.
    </p>
    <p>
      王小花：
      就盼着两样都有吧！妈！
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Xiaohua:
      Mom, I hope that both of those things will be true.
    </p>

      周秀花：
      你倒想得好，可哪能那么容易！去吧，小花，在路上留神吉普车！
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhou Xiuhua:
      It is easy to think about it but not so easy for it to happen.
      OK,  Xiao Hua.  Go! Be careful of jeeps on the road.
