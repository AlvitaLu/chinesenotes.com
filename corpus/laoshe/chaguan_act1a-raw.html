      王利发：
      唐先生，你外边遛遛吧！
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Lifa:
      Mr. Tang, please go outside!

      唐铁嘴：
      惨笑）王掌柜，捧捧唐铁嘴吧！送给我碗茶喝，我就先给您相相面吧！手相奉送，不取分文！（不容分说，拉过王利发的手来）今年是光绪二十四年，戊戌。您贵庚是……

      Tang Tiezui:
        (With a bitter smile) Shopkeeper Wang, let Tang Tiezui hold your hand! 
        Give me a cup of tea to drink and I will tell your fortune!
        I will tell your fortune for free and not take a single penny!
        Not accepting an explanation, he pulled Wang Lifa's hand closer.
        This year is the 24th year of Guang Xu's reign, Fifth Heavenly Stem and
        Eleventh Earthly Branch. You are seventh in order ...
    </p>
    <p>
      王利发：
      （夺回手去）算了吧，我送你一碗茶喝，你就甭卖那套生意口啦！用不着相面，咱们既在江湖内，都是苦命人！（由柜台内走出，让唐铁嘴坐下）坐下！我告诉你，你要是不戒了大烟，就永远交不了好运！这是我的相法，比你的更灵验！
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Lifa:
      (Taking his hand back) 
      Forget it! I will give you a cup of tea but do not sell that kind of
      business in here! We don't have any need for fortune telling.  We all
      have bitter lives and there is already no way out. (Coming out from the
      sales counter, allowing Tang Tiezui to sit down.) Sit down!
      Let me tell you that if you do not give up opium you will never be able to
      give anyone good luck! This is my method for fortune telling and it is
      more effective than yours!
