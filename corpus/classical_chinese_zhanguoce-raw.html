        Stratagems of the Warring States

        Stratagems of the Warring States 戰國策, also known in
        English as Intrigues of the Warring States, Chronicles of the Warring,
        or Records of the Warring States, is a well known historical work on the
        Warring States Period compiled between the third and first centuries
        BCE. It throws light on the political views of the period and also the
        social characteristics of the time. The original author(s) are not know
        but it was later discovered by Liu Xiang 劉向 (79—8 BCE) in the Imperial
        Library. He edited and compiled it into a single work from a number of
        fragments. See entries for Liu Xiang in the 
        <a href='classical_chinese_references.html'>References</a>.

        Zeng Shen Kills Someone
      </h4>
      <h5>《戰國策》 卷四 秦二</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        昔者曾子處費，費人有與曾子同名族者而殺人，人告曾子母曰：「曾參殺人。』曾子之母曰：『吾者不殺人。』置自若。有頃焉，人又曰：『曾參殺人。』其母尚置自若也。頃之，一人又告之曰：『曾參殺人。』其母懼，投杼逾牆牆而走。夫以曾參之賢，與母之信也
      </p>
      <h5>From Qin 2</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        Long ago the Zeng Zi lived in the city of Bi.
        [A city in the state of Lu, under the juristiction of the East China 
        Sea.]
        There was a man from Bi with the same name and clan [name, clan, and 
        surname] as Zeng Zi who killed someone.
        Someone told Zeng's mother “Zeng Shen has killed someone.”
        Zeng Zi's mother said, “My son would not kill anyone.”
        She continued to weave calmly.
        [Seemingly, as if it was in the past.]
        Shortly afterwards someone else said, “Zeng Shen has killed someone.”
        His mother still continued to calmly weave.
        Shortly afterwards another man told her, “Zeng Shen has killed someone.”
        His mother became afraid, threw away her shuttle, climbed over the wall
        and left.
        [Climbed over the wall and fled.]
        In spite of Zeng Shen's virtue and his mother's and his mother's faith
        in him when three 
        men accuse him his mother, despite her love, his mother was unable to
        have faith.
