        Digitization 数字化
      </h2>
      <p>
        Digitiization can be useful in modern decorations, posters,
        and other decorative items created with historic themes.  
        A basic technique is to take photographs with my digital camera,
        a digital SLD, upload to a computer, and vectorize using Inkscape.  
        Inkspace is a freely available open source program
        described in the article on this web site, 
        <span class='bookTitle'><a href='chinese_fonts.php'>Chinese Fonts 汉字字体</a></span>.
        This will result in a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file that can be conveniently manipulated to change color, size,
        etc without loosing fidelity and then exported to PNG file for display in web pages or elsewhere.
        The links to the SVG files are beneath the PNG images below.

      <p>
        The originals are well out of copyright but there is some technique involved
        in creating images that are useful in web pages.

          <div class='picture_header'>Fire Design</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Some of the images were vectorized from bitmaps using the Inkscape path generation tool (e.g., animal mask design)
        and others were created by tracing and other manual tools (e.g., fire design).
