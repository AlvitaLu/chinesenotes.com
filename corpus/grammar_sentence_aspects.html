      <p>
        The states of an action include progression, continuation, and completion.
        In Chinese adverbs and aspectual particles are often used to express the state of an action.

      <h3 class='article'><a name='progressive'></a>动作的进行 The Progressive Aspect of an Action</h3>
      <p>
        The adverbs 正、在、and 正在 placed in front of a predicate verb indicate that the action is in progress. The modal particle 呢 may also be added to the end of the sentence. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>我正在给你处理。 I am taking care of it for you right now.
          <p>
            (The action of 处理 is progressing.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我在休息。 I am resting.
          <p>
            (The action of resting is in progress.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>他睡觉呢。 He is sleeping.
          <p>
            (The modal particle 呢 expresses that the action 睡觉 is in progress. An adverbial adjunct is not needed.)
          </p>
          <li>他没睡觉，他在看书呢。 He is not asleep, he is reading a book.
            <p>
              (The negative form uses the adverb 没.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='continuous'></a>动作的持续 The Continuous Aspect of an Action</h3>
      <p>
        The aspectual particle 着 expresses that an action or the result of an action is continuing. The state of an action or the result of an action can be in the past, present, or future. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>门开着。 The door is open.
          <p>
            (The action of the door opening has already been completed but the state still continues.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>他带着笔记本。 He brought a notebook.
          <p>
            The aspectual particle 着 is placed before the object 笔记本.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我们昨晚到的时候门还开着。 Last night when we arrived it was still open.
          <p>
            (The use of 昨晚 indicates that the condition is in the past.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='perfect'></a>动作的完成 The Perfect Aspect of an Action</h3>
      <p>
        When added after a predicate verb, the aspectual particle 了 expresses the completion of an action. A completed action may take place in the past, present, or future and a time word or phrase is used to express this. For example,
      <p/>
      <ol>
        <li>我成功了。 I succeeded.
          <p>
            (The aspectual particle 了 is added after the predicate verb 成功.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我到了大使馆。 I have arrived at the embassy.
          <p>
            (The aspectual particle 了 is placed after the predicate verb 到 and before the object 大使馆.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我没买火车票。 I did not buy a train ticket.
          <p>
            (The negative form uses the adverb 没.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我洗手了。 I washed my hands.
          <p>
             (In this sentence 了 is a modal particle. The object 手 is simple and the sentence ends with the modal particle 了 so the aspectual particle 了 after the verb is left out.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我买到了机票。 (I bought the plane tickets.)
          <p>
            (The aspectual particle 了 should be placed after the complement of result 到.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>你买到了没有？ Did you buy some?
          <p>
            (没有 can be added to raise a question.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='future'></a>将来的动作 Future Actions</h3>
      <p>
        The adverb 要 and the modal particle 了 can be used to describe an action that will happen in the future. The adverb 要 functions as an adverbial adjunct. The negative form uses the combination 还没.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>老板快要退休了。 Our boss is going to retire soon.</li>
        <li>我们孩子明年要考大学了。 Next year our child will take the college entrance exam.</li>
        <li>我还没毕业。 I have not graduated yet.</li>
        <li>他们快结婚了。 They will get married soon.
          <p>
            (If the adverb 快 is used then 要 can be omitted. Also, when using the adverb 快 a concrete time cannot be stated.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='past'></a>过去的动作 Past Actions</h3>
      <p>
        To describe an experience in the past the aspectual particle 过 can be added after the predicate verb. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>我去过上海。 I have been to Shanghai.
          <p>
             (The object 上海 is placed after the aspectual particle 过.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我曾经学过物理学。 I studied physics before.
          <p>
            (The adverb 曾经 can also be used before the predicate verb.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我没去过首都博物馆。 (I have never been to the Beijing Museum.)
          <p>
            (Use the adverb 没 for the negative form.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
