<h3>明清故宫（北京故宫、沈阳故宫）</h3>
<p>Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang</p>

<p>北京故宫于1987年被列入《世界遗产名录》，沈阳故宫作为其扩展项目也被列入其中，目前称为明清故宫（北京故宫和沈阳故宫）。沈阳清朝故宫建于1625-1626年至1783年间，共有114座建筑，其中包括一个极为珍贵的藏书馆。沈阳故宫是统治中国的最后一个朝代在将权力扩大到全国中心、迁都北京之前，朝代建立的见证，后来成为北京故宫的附属皇宫建筑。这座雄伟的建筑为清朝历史以及满族和中国北方其他部族的文化传统提供了重要的历史见证。</p>
<p>[English text does not match Chinese] Seat of supreme power for over five centuries (1416-1911), the Forbidden City in Beijing, with its landscaped gardens and many buildings (whose nearly 10,000 rooms contain furniture and works of art), constitutes a priceless testimony to Chinese civilization during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Imperial Palace of the Qing Dynasty in Shenyang consists of 114 buildings constructed between 1625–26 and 1783. It contains an important library and testifies to the foundation of the last dynasty that ruled China, before it expanded its power to the centre of the country and moved the capital to Beijing. This palace then became auxiliary to the Imperial Palace in Beijing. This remarkable architectural edifice offers important historical testimony to the history of the Qing Dynasty and to the cultural traditions of the Manchu and other tribes in the north of China.</p>
