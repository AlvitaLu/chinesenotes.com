伊尹相湯伐桀，升自陑，遂與桀戰于鳴條之野。作《湯誓》。

王曰：「格爾眾庶，悉聽朕言！非台小子敢行稱亂；有夏多罪，天命殛之。今爾有眾，汝曰：『我后不恤我眾，舍我穡事而割正（夏）？』予惟聞汝眾言，夏氏有罪。予畏上帝，不敢不正。今汝其曰：『夏罪、其如台？』夏王率遏眾力，率割夏邑。有眾率怠弗協。曰：『時日曷喪？予及汝皆亡！』夏德若茲，今朕必往。

The king said, 'Come, ye multitudes of the people, listen all to my words. It is not I, the little child, who dare to undertake a rebellious enterprise; but for the many crimes of the sovereign of Xia, Heaven has given the charge to destroy him. Now, ye multitudes, you are saying, "Our prince does not compassionate us, but (is calling us) away from our husbandry to attack and punish Xia." I have indeed heard (these) words of you all; (but) the sovereign of Xia is guilty, and as I fear God, I dare not but punish him. Now you are saying, "What are the crimes of Xia to us?" The king of Xia in every way exhausts the strength of his people, and exercises oppression in the cities of Xia. His multitudes are become entirely indifferent (to his service), and feel no bond of union'(to him). They are saying, "When wilt thou, O sun, expire? We will all perish with thee." Such is the course of (the sovereign) of Xia, and now I must go (and punish him).'

爾尚輔予一人致天之罰，予其大賚汝。爾無不信，朕不食言。爾不從誓言，予則孥戮汝，罔有攸赦。」

'Assist, I pray you, me, the One man, to carry out the punishment appointed by Heaven. I will greatly reward you. On no account disbelieve me - I will not eat my words. If you do not obey the words which I have thus spoken to you, I will put your children to death with you - you shall find no forgiveness.'

湯既勝夏。欲遷其社不可。作《夏社》、《疑至》、《臣扈》。

夏師敗績，湯遂從之，遂伐三朡，俘厥寶玉。誼伯、仲伯作《典寶》。
