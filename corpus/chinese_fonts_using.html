<h3>如何拿到并用汉字字体 Getting and Using Chinese Fonts</h3>

      <p>
        Before going deeper into what Chinese fonts are and font technology, I will discuss getting and using Chinese fonts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first problem that people with a non-Chinese operating systems will often encounter is basic display of Chinese text.
        Unicode fonts are a very useful solution to this because they can enable display a wide range of characters, not just
        Chinese but from many languages.  Some well known and readily available Unicode fonts are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Arial Unicode MS, a proprietary font from Microsoft with 38,917 characters, included with Microsoft Office
          [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Microsoft, 2010b</a>]
        </li>
        <li>
          Bitstream Cyberbit, a freeware font, for non-commercial use only, with 32,910 characters.
          [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Bitstream</a>]
        </li>
        <li>
          GNU Unifont, GPL with 63,446 characters
          [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Unifoundry.com 2008</a>]
        </li>
        <li>
          HanNom [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Le Van Dang 2005</a>] The HanNom fonts have wider coverage than most
          of the other fonts listed here.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A good way to check the breadth of support in your system is by using the <span class='bookTitle'>ICU Unicode Browser</span>
        [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php'>ICU</a>] or with the <span class='bookTitle'>Font Test Page</span>
        [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php'>Sturgeon</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        This may solve your problem in being able to read most Chinese characters.  
        However, Unicode fonts are mostly designed with maximum coverage and readability in mind.
        For doing graphic design with Chinese fonts you will likely want something with a specific design.
        Some sources are listed below.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          WenQuanYi Bitmap Song, GPL with 41,295 characters
          [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Fang 2006</a>]
        </li>
        <li>
          WenQuanYi Zen Hei, GPL with 41,587 characters
          [<a href='chinese_fonts_ref.php#references'>Fang 2009</a>]
        </li>
      </ol>
