      <h2 class='article'><a name='simple'></a>单句 Simple Sentences</h2>
      <p>
        Sentences are formed from words and phrases using grammatical rules to express a complete idea.
        In general, simple sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate.
        Sentences can also be classified as either subject-predicate sentences or non subject-predicate sentences.
        Subject-predicate sentences use a subject section and a predicate section. 
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>他   学习物理学。 (He studies physics.) “他”是主语部分，“学习物理学”是谓语部分。 (他 is the subject section and 学习物理学 is the predicate section.)</li>
        <li>图书馆   很安静。 (The library is very quiet.) “图书馆”是主语部分，“很安静”是谓语部分。 (图书馆 is the predicate section and 很安静 is the predicate section.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Subject-predicate sentences can be divided into those with a verbal predicate, those adjectival predicate, 
        those with a nominal predicate, and those with a subject-predicate phrase as the predicate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Non subject-predicate sentences can be classified as subjectless sentences, one word sentences, and elliptical sentences.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>夏雨了。 (It's raining.)</li>
        <li>看！ (Watch out!)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Simple sentences can also be classified by their use.
        Simple sentences can be classified as declarative sentences, interrogative sentences, imperative sentences, 
        or exclamatory sentences.
      </p>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='verbal'></a>动词谓语句 Sentences with a Verbal Predicate</h3>
      <p>
        Sentences with a verbal predicate use a verb as the predicate to state what the subject does.
        In general, sentences with a verbal predicate have three forms:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Subject + predicate (verb)
          <ol>
            <li class='secondLevel'>咱们商量。 Let's talk it over. (咱们 is the subject section and 商量 is the predicate section, which is a verb.)</li>
            <li class='secondLevel'>我走。 I am going. (The subject section is 我 and the predicate section is 走了, which uses the verb 走.)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Subject + predicate (transitive verb) + object
          <ol>
            <li class='secondLevel'>我买菜。 I am buying vegetables. (我 is the subject, 买 is the predicate and is a transitive verb, and 菜 is the object.)</li>
            <li class='secondLevel'>他学习英文。 He studies English. (他 is the subject, 学习 is the predicate and also a transitive verb, and 英文 is the object.)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Subject + predicate (transitive verb) + indirect object + direct object
          <ol>
            <li class='secondLevel'>老师教我们英语。 The teacher is teaching us English. (老师 is the subject, 教 is the predicate and also a transitive verb, 我们 is an indirect object, and 英语 is a direct object.)</li>
            <li class='secondLevel'>我给你钱。 I will give you the money. (我 is the subject, 给 is the predicate and also a transitive verb, 你 is an indirect object, and 钱 is a direct object.)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Use the negating adverb 不 before the predicate adverb to express "never in the future", "not often", "not willing", etc. If the predicate verb is 有 then use the negating adverb 没. If the action has not yet occured or not yet been completed use the negative adverb 没 or 没有. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>孩子不吃饭。 The child is not eating. (The adverb 不 expresses that the child is not willing to eat.)
        </li>
        <li>我没有车。 I have not got a car. (The predicate verb is 有.)</li>
        <li>我还没去。 I haven't gone yet. (The action has not yet taken place.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='adjectival'></a>Sentences with an Adjectival Predicate</h3>
      <p>
        Sentences with an adjectival predicate use an adjective to describe what the subject is like.
        Its basic forms are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>[Affirmative form] Subject + predicate (adjective)
          <ol>
            <li class='secondLevel'>人多。 There are a lot of people. (人 is the subject, 多 is the predicate and is an adjective.)</li>
            <li class='secondLevel'>天气热。 The weather is hot. (天气 is the subject, 热 is the predicate and is an adjective.)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>[Negative form] Subject + adverbial adjunct (adverb 不) + predicate (adjective)
          <ol>
            <li class='secondLevel'>汽车不新。 The car is not new. (汽车 is the subject, 新 is the predicate and is an adjective.)</li>
            <li class='secondLevel'>他不聪明。 He is not clever. (他 is the subject, 聪明 is the predicate and is an adjective.)</ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The adverb 很 is often used before the predicate adverb, acting as an adverbial adjunct but does not generally express degree. If the adverb 很 is not used then a comparison is usually meant. The adverbs 真、太、最、更、比较、十分、相当、特别、非常 are often used to express degree. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>他很高。 He is tall. (The adverb 很 does not express degree.)</li>
        <li>他高。 He is taller. (Without 很 a comparison is meant.)</li>
        <li>他特别高。 He is extremely tall. (The adverb 特别 expresses degree.)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='nominal'></a>Sentences with a Nominal Predicate</h3>
      <p>
        Sentences with nominal predicates use a noun or a nominal endocentric phrase to express a sum of money, a festival,
        a profession, a solar term, a date, or a person's age.
        Sentences with nominal predicates are usually short and simple.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>明天初一。 Tomorrow is the first day of the lunar month. (The noun 初一 acts as the predicate.)</li>
        <li>爷爷九十多岁。 Grandfather is over ninety years old. (The numeral-measure word phrase 九十多岁 acts as the predicate.)</li>
        <li>这些橙子多少钱？ How much are these oranges? (The nominal endocentric phrase 多少钱 acts as the predicate.)</li>
        <li>现在八点。 It's eight o'clock. (The numeral-measure word phrase 八点 acts as the predicate.)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='sp'></a>Sentences with a Subject-Predicate Phrase as the Predicate</h3>
      <p>
        These sentences use a subject-predicate phrase as the predicate. For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>他身体健康。 He is healthy. (The pronoun他 is the subject and the subject-predicate phrase 身体健康 is the subject.)</li>
        <li>这个学校水平很高。 The standards at this school are very high. (这个学校 is the subject and the subject-predicate phrase 水平很高 is the subject.)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='subjectless'></a>Subjectless Sentences</h3>
      <p>
        Subjectless sentences do not have a subject section.
        In this type of sentence there is either no clear subject or the subject does not need to be articulated.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>刮风了。 It's windy. (No need to articulate 天 as the subject.)</li>
        <li>下课了。 School's out. (No subject is needed.)</li>
        <li>买单。 Check, please. (No need to use 我 as the subject.)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='one_word'></a>One Word Sentences</h3>
      <p>
        One word sentences include only a single word or a single endocentric phrase.
        They are used to express time or place, praise, a discovery, a warning, to address someone, agreement, opposition, or
        a question.  For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>危险！Danger! (a warning)</li>
        <li>怎么？ How is that? (a question)</li>
        <li>好球！ Good shot! (admiration)</li>
        <li>好的。 That's fine. (agreement)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='elliptical'></a>Elliptical Sentences</h3>
      <p>
        In an elliptical sentence only a part of the whole sentence is spoken because the meaning can be understood from the context.
        Elliptical sentences are often used in conversation. 
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>（你买不买？）（我）不买。(The subject is ommitted.)</li>
        <li>（你想吃什么？）（我想吃）饺子。 (What would you like to eat?) (I would like to eat) Dumplings. (The subject and predicate are omitted.)</li>
        <li>（谁去？）我（去）。 (Who is going?) Me. (I am going) (The predicate is omitted.)</li>
      </ol>
