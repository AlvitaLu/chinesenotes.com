        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most historic texts and literature written before the beginning of the 
        Twentieth Century in China were written in literary Chinese.
        There is a very large body of literary Chinese texts, some of which are
        included in this digital library and most of which are not yet
        translated to English.
        Literary Chinese also lingers on in modern Chinese in the form of
        embedded idioms and common sayings. Perhaps because written Chinese can
        be read independently of pronunciation it has survived in such a
        recognizable form for so long and been used over a very broad geographic
        area, including all of East Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        When studying Chinese history, literature, and philosophy it is common
        to study original texts, of which are many and, in contrast
        to Old English and Latin, have a long continuous tradition until the
        transition from literary Chinese to modern Chinese in written text
        around the start of the Twentieth Century.  Literary Chinese is
        encountered in Buddhist texts, whose original translations from Sanskrit
        are still in wide use today in the Chinese Buddhist community.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document was written to be a gentle introduction for learners with
        minimal background in modern Chinese or even none at all. You can mouse
        over or click on any of the Chinese text to find the English
        and Pinyin for the Chinese and follow a hyperlink to additional details.
        Where there are multiple definitions for a given word the mouseover and
        link will be for the right alternative for the given context, especially
        where the classical use differs from the modern use.

        Historical Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first known forms of Chinese writings were written on animal bones
        in a style known as oracle bone script 甲骨文 in the Shang Dynasty 商
        (1700 to 1045 BCE).  In the Zhou Dynasty 周 (1045—221 BCE) there were
        inscriptions on bronze vessels.  The very early Chinese classics
        The Book of Changes or I Ching 易經, Book of History 書經, and
        Book of Songs 詩經 also date from the Zhou Dynasty. These texts are in a
        very early style referred to as Old Chinese 上古漢語
        (Norman, 1988, p. 23).
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms Classical Chinese (古文) and Literary Chinese (文言文 or 文言)
        are often loosely used interchangably. Classical Chinese more properly
        refers to written Chinese from the end of the Spring and Autumn period
        through to the end of the Han Dynasty. (Norman, 1988, p. 83)
        This include the time of Confucius 孔子 (c. 551&mdash;479 BCE),
        continues through the Warring States Period 戰國時代 (475—221 BCE) to
        the Qin Dynasty 秦, when China was first unified in 221 BCE.  
        This was the period of the great philosphers, including the founders of
        the schools of Confucianism 儒家, Taoism 道家, Legalism 法家, and
        Mohism 墨家. After the unification of China in the Qin there was
        convergence in the written language. However, as time went on the
        written form 文言 literary Chinese diverged from the spoken form.
        Literary Chinese refers to the style of written Chinese commonly used
        right through to the end of the Qing Dynasty 清.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are considerable regional differences between the styles of
        writing during the classical period, including (1) the continuation of
        a more archaic style, including Zuozhuan 左傳 and Book of Historical 
        Narrative 國語; (2) a Lu 鲁 style, including The Analects of
        Confucius 論語 and Mencius 孟子; (3) a Chu 楚 style, including Sorrow at
        Parting 離騷 in Songs of Chu 楚辭; and (4) a style found in
        Zhuang Zi 莊子, Han Feizi 韓非子, and Xun Zi 荀子 that leads towards a
        common standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buddhist texts were brought to China from India and translated from
        Sanskrit and Pali over a period of many hundred years, starting in the
        Han 漢 (221 BCE—220 CE), continuing through to the Tang 唐 (618—907 CE).
        Some of these translations are still popular today, for example
        The Sutra on the Eight Realizations of the Great Beings 佛說八大人覺經
        (Nhất Hạnh, 1987) translated by the Buddhist monk An Shi Gao 安世高 in
        the Later Han and Heart Sutra 心經 translated by the Chinese monk
        Xuanzang 玄奘 (602&mdash;664 CE) in the Tang.
        (Yifa et al., 2006)
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus of many introductions to literary Chinese is the classical
        period. However, later periods are also very important for the study
        of histories, Buddhist texts, and later literature.

        Language Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese is considered a polysyllabic language because most of the
        words in the language have two characters. Literary Chinese is
        considered basically a monosyllabic language. That is most words consist
        of a single character. There are many exceptions to this,
        however:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bound compounds whose meanings cannot be deduced from either character
          alone. For example, 君子 'nobleman'
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollysyllabic loan words from foreign languages, 
          especially many Buddhist terms from Sanskrit, for example,
          a Buddhist monk 沙門 and a Buddhist nun 比丘尼
        </li>
        <li>
          Binomes, which are an intensifying expression that joins together two
          words with similar pronuncation. For example, 崢嶸, which describes
          the lofty nature of tall mountains was pronounced dzaeng-yuaeng in
          Middle Chinese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Polar binomes, which are a form where writers use an opposite or
          similar pair of words to refer to a set or range. For example, 草木 
          'grasses and trees' refers to all vegetation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduplication of certain words can expand the meaning of the word on 
          its own.  For example, 年 (year) when reduplicated 年年 means year
          after year. The word 人 (person / people) when reduplicated 人人 means
          everybody.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese has a number of affixes and particles, such as
        了、過、者、得.  However, compared with European languages it has 
        relatively few affixes. Classical Chinese has even fewer affixes than
        modern Chinese. Two plural forms that were commonly used from the
        Warring States Period on are 諸 and 等.
      </p>
      <h3 class='article'>
        <a id="pronunciation"></a>Pronunciation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Spoken Chinese has varied over its history and geographic areas and
        sounds used in previous times can only be reconstructed from fragmentary
        evidence. It is generally divided into three periods: Old Chinese
        (Shang 商 and Zhou 周 to Western Han 西漢), Middle Chinese (Eastern Han
        東漢 to Early Tang 初唐), and Mandarin (Tang 唐 to Qing 清).
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the knowledge of Old Chinese comes from analysis of rhymes in
        The Book of Songs 詩經 and Erya 爾雅, the first Chinese dictionary,
        dating to about the third century BCE. In addition, comparisons with
        other languages and loan words from Indo-European languages have been
        used to understand pronunciation of Old Chinese. In addition, many
        radicals are related to the pronunciation of characters.
        Also, the dictionary, Shuo Wen Jie Zi 說文解字 appeared in the Han
        Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge of Middle Chinese pronunciation is more complete than Old Chinese because
        Chinese scholars of the time compiled rhyming dictionaries, including
        Qieyun 切韻 compiled by Lu Fayan 陸法言 in about 600 CE.  The the
        fan qie 反切 system used in dictionaries, such as Qieyun, each entry
        consisted of two characters to represent the sound of a word.  The
        first character had the same initial sound and the second character had
        the same final sound. Qieyun formed the basis of
        Guangyun dictionary 廣韻 in around 1011 CE after many revisions and 
        additions. The fan qie system was also used in the Kangxi Dictionary
        康熙字典 (1716) considered the first modern Chinese dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Middle Chinese had four tones but there were different
        from modern Chinese.  The were level 平, rising 上, falling 去, and
        entering 入 (Rouzer 2007, p. 24). Entering tones ended with a p, t, or k.
        The tones were first documented by Shen Yue 沈約 in the fifth century CE.
        In the Qieyun dictionaries the tones were represented by small circles
        at the four corners of the characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we think about the diversity of the modern dialects of Chinese we
        can appreciate the difficulty of understanding pronunciation from the
        various regions of China thoughout the past 2,400 years or so. 
        Nevertheless, classical Chinese is commonly read aloud in modern
        Mandarin, for example in Buddhist chanting. There are eight major modern
        dialects that can be divided into three groups.

        Shuo Wen Jie Zi 說文解字 was the first etymological dictionary, attributed to
        Xu Shen 許慎 in the second century CE.
        Shuowen Jiezi had six methods for forming Chinese characters 六書:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ideograms 指事, indicating an idea &mdash; for example 上 up
        </li>
        <li>
          pictograms 象形, derived from a picture &mdash; for example, 月 moon
        </li>
        <li>
          phonogram 形聲, derived from a radical indicating meaning plus phonetic part
          &mdash; for example, 河 river that combines 水 water and 可 with the modern sound ke 
        </li>
        <li>
          combined ideogram 會意 that combines the meanings of existing elements
          &mdash; for example, 鳴 to chirp, that combines mouth (口)
          and bird (鳥)
        </li>
        <li>
          transfer character 轉註, with meanings influenced by other words &mdash;
          for example, 老 old to 考 to examine
        </li>
        <li>
          loan character 假借, acquiring meanings by phonetic association &mdash; for example, 安
          peace to the same character for use as an interogative pronoun

      </h3>
      <p>
        As pointed out by Rouzer (2007, p. 8) parts of speech, such as noun,
        verb, and so on, are useful but you should bear in mind that words are
        used flexibly in literary Chinese. Also, the flexible use of some
        words in some contexts does not mean that there is no grammar and that
        any word can be used in any grammatical context. The notes here are 
        intended to be helpful but please do not take them as strict rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general rules of word order are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          subject precedes predicate
        </li>
        <li>
          a modifier precedes the word it modifies
        </li>
        <li>
          a verb precedes its object
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Words can shift grammatical function in classical Chinese within certain patterns.  
        Here are a few constant rules to help distinguish grammatical function.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
          Nouns are negated by 非，無.
          </p>
          <p>
          For example,
          </p>
          <p>
          雖寶<span class='hl'>非</span>用。
          Even jewels have no use. 左思《三部賦序》
          (From Zuo Si, Three Part Poetic Essay)
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class='hl'>無</span>衣無褐，何以來歲？
          Without clothes or hemp, how will we pass the years?
          《詩經》
          (From the Book of Songs)
          </p>
          <p>
          Verbs are negated by 未，不，勿，某
          </p>
          <p>
          However, direct objects can be placed after a negating word and before the verb, which
          can make this rule less obvious to recognize.
          </p>
          <p>
            The topic is often omitted when it is understood.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          A verbal construction must follow 所.
        </li>
        <li>
          之
          is often used to mark subordination.  Placing it between the subject and verb of a subject-predicate
          phrase turns it into a nominal phrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most words that we think of as adjectives in English can act as static verbs.  That is
          verbs that describe state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are five types of grammatical relationships: topic-comment, verb-object,
        coordination, subordination, and number complement.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Topic-Comment
          <p>
          This is a variation of the subject-predicate relation but a little
          more broad. The topic is the focus of the phrase and most often is
          placed first. The comment is a statement about the topic. The simplest
          type of topic-comment phrase is a nominal sentence that identifies one
          noun with another. Nominal sentences with the pattern A B 也 most
          frequently mean A is a B or A is a type of B.
          A 猶
          B 也
          (A is like B) is another form of nominal sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Topicalization is the transfer of the usual order of a sentence to
            change the element that is being stressed.  This is an important
            tool in classical Chinese rhetoric. For example, from Zhuang Zi 莊子,
          </p>
          <p>
            臣之所好者道也
            <br/>
            What I, your servant, like is The Way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Topicalization is one type of a broader movement of sentence
            elements to the front called exposure.  Exposure is often used for
            rhetorical emphasis or to mark a contrast.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Verb-Object
          <p>
            The simplest case of a verb-object is a verb and a direct object.
            For example, 飲酒 (to drink wine). Sometimes the object of a verb is
            another verb. For example, 使歸 (to cause to return).
          </p>
          <p>
            Time and place information usually expressed through prepositional
            phrases in English and modern Chinese are expressed using 
            verb-object relations in classical Chinese. The time and place words
            are locative objects of verbs. For example, 居山中 (to live in the
            mountains). Sometimes the locative particle 於 will be used. However,
            some references classify 於 as a preposition in the context of
            literary Chinese.
          </p>
          <p>
            Auxiliary verbs are used in a similar way to modern Chinese.
            Frequently used auxiliary verbs are 應， 能， 必， 肯， 須. 
            For example, 應歸 (should return).           
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinate Relationships
          <p>
            In a coordinate relationship two terms of the same type are used
            together. The elements may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
            adverbs, or phrases. The conjunctions 與， 且， 而， 或， and 將 are
            frequently used to join terms in a coordinate 
            relationship. However, conjunctions are also often omitted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Subordinate Relations
          <p>
            In a subordinate relation the first element modifies the second. The
            first element is the modifier and the second element is 
            called the head. For example, 青草 green (modifier ) grass (head).
            The elements of a subordinate relation can be nouns, 
            verbs, or phrases.
          </p>
          <p>
            之 is a marker for explicit subordination to a noun. It turns a
            verbal phrase into a nominal phrase. For example, 
            日出之陽 (the sun at sunrise, from 說苑 Garden of Stories). 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Number Complements
          <p>
            A number complement relation has the form (number) + (measure). Here
            the measure is a noun that is a measure of some kind of 
            quantity. For example, 二人 (two people). Measure words, as found in
            modern Chinese, originated from this form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Punctuation in classical Chinese has mostly been added at a later date
        to make reading easier. In particular, question marks, quotation marks,
        and semi-colons were not used at all in literary Chinese.  Some literary
        Chinese text used no punctation at all, making it very difficult for
        modern readers. Some texts used periods in place of both periods and
        modern commas. This web page uses basic periods and commas in order to
        make text a little more readable but avoids more modern additions like
        question marks, quotation marks, and semi-colons.
