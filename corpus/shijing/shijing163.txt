毛詩序：「《四牡》，勞使臣之來也。有功而見知則說矣。」


四牡
四牡騑騑，周道倭遲。豈不懷歸？王事靡盬，我心傷悲。

My four steeds advanced without stopping;
The way from Zhou was winding and tedious.
Did I not have the wish to return?
But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;
And my heart was wounded with sadness.

四牡騑騑，嘽嘽駱馬。豈不懷歸？王事靡盬，不遑啟處。

My four steeds advanced without stopping;
They panted and snorted, the white steeds black-maned.
Did I not have the wish to return?
But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;
And I had not leisure to kneel or to sit.

翩翩者鵻，載飛載下，集于苞栩。王事靡盬，不遑將父。

The Filial doves keep flying about,
Now soaring aloft, and now descending,
Collecting on the bushy oaks;
But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;
And I had not leisure to nourish my father.

翩翩者鵻，載飛載止，集于苞杞。王事靡盬，不遑將母。

The Filial doves keep flying about,
Now flying, now stopping,
Collecting on the bushy medlars;
But the king's business was not to be slackly performed;
And I had not leisure to nourish my mother.

駕彼四駱，載驟駸駸。豈不懷歸？是用作歌，將母來諗。

I yoked my four white steeds, black-maned;
They hurried away with speed.
[But] did I not wish to return?
Therefore I make this song,
Announcing my wish to nourish my mother.

《四牡》，五章，章五句。
