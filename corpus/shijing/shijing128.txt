毛詩序：「《駟驖》，美襄公也。始命有田狩之事，園囿之樂焉。」


駟驖
駟驖孔阜，六轡在手。公之媚子，從公于狩。

His four iron-black horses are in very fine condition;
The six reins are in the hand [of the charioteer].
The ruler's favourites,
Follow him to the chase.

奉時辰牡，辰牡孔碩。公曰左之，舍拔則獲。

The male animals of the season are made to present themselves,
The males in season, of very large size.
The ruler says, ' To the left of them; '
Then he lets go his arrows and hits.

遊于北園，四馬既閑。輶車鸞鑣，載獫歇驕。

He rambles in the northern park;
His four horses display their training.
Light carriages, with bells at the horses' bits,
Convey the long and short-mouthed dogs.

《駟驖》，三章，章四句。
