毛詩序：「《大叔于田》，刺莊公也。叔多才而好勇，不義而得衆也。」


大叔于田
大叔于田，乘乘馬。執轡如組，兩驂如舞。叔在藪，火烈具舉，襢裼暴虎，獻于公所。將叔無狃，戒其傷女。

Shu has gone hunting,
Mounted in his chariot and four.
The reins are in his grasp like ribbons,
While the two outside horses move [with regular steps], as dancers do.
Shu is at the marshy ground; -
The fire flames out all at once,
And with bared arms he seizes a tiger,
And presents it before the duke.
O Shu, try not [such sport] again;
Beware of getting hurt.

叔于田，乘乘黃。兩服上襄，兩驂鴈行。叔在藪，火烈具揚。叔善射忌，又良御忌，抑磬控忌，抑縱送忌。

Shu has gone hunting,
Mounted in his chariot with four bay horses.
The two insides are the finest possible animals,
And the two outsides follow them regularly as in a flying flock of wild geese.
Shu is at the marshy ground; -
The fire blazes up all at once,
A skillful archer is Shu!
A good charioteer also!
Now he gives his horse the reins; now he brings them up;
Now he discharges his arrows; now he follows it.

叔于田，乘乘鴇。兩服齊首，兩驂如手。叔在藪，火烈具阜。叔馬慢忌，叔發罕忌，抑釋掤忌，抑鬯弓忌。

Shu has gone hunting,
Mounted in his chariot with four grey horses.
His two insides have their heads in a line,
And the two outsides come after like arms.
Shu is at the marsh; -
The fire spreads grandly all together.
His horses move slowly;
He shoots but seldom;
Now he lays aside his quiver;
Now he returns his bows to his case.

《大叔于田》，三章，章十句。
