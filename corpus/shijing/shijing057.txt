毛詩序：「《考槃》，刺莊公也。不能繼先公之業，使賢者退而窮處。」


考槃
考槃在澗，碩人之寬，獨寐寤言，永矢弗諼。

He has reared his hut by the stream in the valley,
- That large man, so much at his ease.
Alone he sleeps, and wakes, and talks.
He swears he will never forgets [his true joy].

考槃在阿，碩人之薖，獨寐寤歌，永矢弗過。

He has reared his hut in the bend of the mound,
- That large man, with such an air of indifference.
Alone he sleeps, and wakes, and sings.
He swears he will never pass from the spot.

考槃在陸，碩人之軸，獨寐寤宿，永矢弗告。

He has reared his hut on the level height,
- That large man, so self-collected.
Alone, he sleeps and wakes, and sleeps again.
He swears he will never tell [of his delight].

《考槃》，三章，章四句。
