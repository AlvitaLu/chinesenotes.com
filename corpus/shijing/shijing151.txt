毛詩序：「《蜉蝣》，刺奢也。昭公國小而迫，無法以自守，好奢而任小人，將無所依焉。」


蜉蝣
蜉蝣之羽，衣裳楚楚。心之憂矣，於我歸處。

The wings of the ephemera,
Are robes, bright and splendid.
My heart is grieved; -
Would they but come and abide with me!

蜉蝣之翼，采采衣服。心之憂矣，於我歸息。

The wings of the ephemera,
Are robes, variously adorned.
My heart is grieved; -
Would they but come and rest with me!

蜉蝣掘閱，麻衣如雪。心之憂矣，於我歸說。

The ephemera bursts from its hole,
With a robe of hemp like snow.
My heart is grieved; -
Would they but come and lodge with me!

《蜉蝣》，三章，章四句。
