毛詩序：「《魚藻》，刺幽王也。言萬物失其性，王居鎬京，將不能以自樂，故君子思古之武王焉。」


魚藻
魚在在藻，有頒其首。王在在鎬，豈樂飲酒。

The fishes are there, there among the pondweed,
Showing their large heads.
The king is here, here in Hao,
At ease and happy, while he drinks.

魚在在藻，有莘其尾。王在在鎬，飲酒樂豈。

The fishes are there, there among the pondweed,
Showing their long tails.
The king is here, here in Hao,
Drinking, happy and at ease.

魚在在藻，依于其蒲。王在在鎬，有那其居。

The fishes are there, there among the pondweed,
Sheltered by the rushes.
The king is here, here in Hao,
Dwelling in tranquillity.


《魚藻》，三章，章四句。
