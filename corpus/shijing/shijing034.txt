毛詩序：「《雄雉》，刺衞宣公也。淫亂不恤國事，軍旅數起，大夫久役，男女怨曠，國人患之而作是詩。」


雄雉
雄雉于飛，泄泄其羽，我之懷矣，自詒伊阻。

The male pheasant flies away,
Lazily moving his wings.
The man of my heart! -
He has brought on us this separation.

雄雉于飛，下上其音，展矣君子，實勞我心。

The pheasant has flown away,
But from below, from above, comes his voice.
Ah! the princely man! -
He afflicts my heart.

瞻彼日月，悠悠我思，道之云遠，曷云能來。

Look at that sun and moon!
Long, long do I think.
The way is distant;
How can he come to me?

百爾君子，不知德行，不忮不求，何用不臧。

All ye princely men,
Know ye not his virtuous conduct?
He hates none; he covets nothing; -
What does he which is not good?

《雄雉》，四章，章四句。
