毛詩序：「《泂酌》，召康公戒成王也。言皇天親有德，饗有道也。」


泂酌
泂酌彼行潦，挹彼注茲，可以餴饎。豈弟君子，民之父母。[1]

Take the pool-water from a distance;
Draw it into one vessel and let it flow to another,
And it may be used to stream rice or millet.
[How much more should] the happy and courteous sovereign,
Be the parent of the people!

泂酌彼行潦，挹彼注茲，可以濯罍。豈弟君子，民之攸歸。

Take the pool-water from a distance;
Draw it into one vessel and let it flow to another,
And it may be used to wash a [spirit] vase.
[How much more should] the happy and courteous sovereign,
Be the centre of attraction to the people!

泂酌彼行潦，挹彼注茲，可以濯溉。豈弟君子，民之攸塈。

Take the pool-water from a distance;
Draw it into one vessel and let it flow to another,
And it may be used for all purpose of cleansing.
[How much more should] the happy and courteous sovereign,
Be the centre of rest to the people!


《泂酌》，三章，章五句。

註解
 豈弟，一作愷悌。下同。
