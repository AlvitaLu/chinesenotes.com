毛詩序：「《女曰鷄鳴》，刺不說德也。陳古義以刺今，不說德而好色也。」


女曰鷄鳴
女曰鷄鳴，士曰昧旦。子興視夜，明星有爛。將翱將翔，弋鳧與鴈。

Says the wife, ' It is cock-crow; '
Says the husband, ' It is grey dawn. '
' Rise, Sir, and look at the night, - '
If the morning star be not shining.
Bestir yourself, and move about,
To shoot the wild ducks and geese.

弋言加之，與子宜之。宜言飲酒，與子偕老。琴瑟在御，莫不靜好。

When your arrows and line have found them,
I will dress them fitly for you.
When they are dressed, we will drink [together over them],
And I will hope to grow old with you.
Your lute in your hands,
Will emits its quiet pleasant tones.

知子之來之，雜佩以贈之。知子之順之，雜佩以問之。知子之好之，雜佩以報之。

When I know those whose acquaintance you wish,
I will give them of the ornaments of my girdle.
When I know those with whom you are cordial,
I will send to them of the ornaments of my girdle.
When I know those whom you love,
I will repay their friendship from the ornaments of my girdle.

《女曰鷄鳴》，三章，章六句。
