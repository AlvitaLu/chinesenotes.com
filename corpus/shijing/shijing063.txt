毛詩序：「《伯兮》，刺時也。言君子行役，為王前驅，過時而不反焉。」


伯兮
伯兮朅兮，邦之桀兮。伯也執殳，爲王前驅。

My noble husband is how martial-like!
The hero of the country!
My husband, grasping his halberd,
Is in the leading chariot of the king's [host].

自伯之東，首如飛蓬。豈無膏沐？誰適爲容！

Since my husband went to the east,
My head has been like the flying [pappus of the] artemisia.
It is not that I could not anoint and wash it;
But for whom should I adorn myself?

其雨其雨，杲杲出日。願言思伯，甘心首疾。

O for rain! O for rain!
But brightly the sun comes forth.
Longingly I think of my husband,
Till my heart is weary, and my head aches.

焉得諼草？言樹之背。願言思伯。使我心痗。

How shall I get the plant of forgetfulness?
I would plant it on the north of my house.
Longingly I think of my husband,
And my heart is made to ache

《伯兮》，四章，章四句。
