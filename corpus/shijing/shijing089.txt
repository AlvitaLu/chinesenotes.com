毛詩序：「《丰》，刺亂也。婚姻之道缺，陽倡而陰不和，男行而女不隨。」


丰
子之丰兮，俟我乎巷兮。悔予不送兮。

Full and good looking was the gentleman,
Who waited for me in the lane!
I repent that I did not go with him.

子之昌兮，俟我乎堂兮。悔予不將兮。

A splendid gentleman was he,
Who waited for me in the hall!
I regret that I did not accompany him.

衣錦褧衣，裳錦褧裳。叔兮伯兮，駕予與行。

Over my embroidered upper robe, I have put on a [plain] single garment;
Over my embroidered lower robe, I have done the same.
O Sir, O Sir,
Have your carriage ready for me to go with you.

裳錦褧裳，衣錦褧衣。叔兮伯兮，駕予與歸。

Over my embroidered lower robe, I have put on a [plain] single garment;
Over my embroidered upper robe, I have done the same.
O Sir, O Sir,
Have your carriage ready to take me home with you.

《丰》，四章：二章，章三句；二章，章四句。
