毛詩序：「《破斧》，美周公也。周大夫以惡四國焉。」


破斧
既破我斧，又缺我斨。周公東征，四國是皇。哀我人斯，亦孔之將。

We broke our axes,
And we splintered our hatchets;
But the object of the duke of Zhou, in marching to the east,
Was to put the four States to rights.
His compassion for us people,
Is very great.

既破我斧，又缺我錡。周公東征，四國是吪。哀我人斯，亦孔之嘉。

We broke our axes,
And we splintered our chisels;
But the object of the duke of Zhou, in marching to the east,
Was to reform the four States.
His compassion for us people,
Is very admirable.

既破我斧，又缺我銶。周公東征，四國是遒。哀我人斯，亦孔之休。

We broke our axes,
And splintered our clubs.
But the object of the duke of Zhou, in marching to the east,
Was to save the alliance of the four States.
His compassion for us people,
Is very excellent.

《破斧》，三章，章六句。
