毛詩序
　　《桃夭》，后妃之所致也。不妬忌，則男女以正，婚姻以時，國無鰥民也。

詩文
桃之夭夭，灼灼其華，之子于歸，宜其室家。

The peach tree is young and elegant;
Brilliant are its flowers.
This young lady is going to her future home,
And will order well her chamber and house.

The peach tree is young and elegant;
Abundant will be its fruits.
This young lady is going to her future home,
And will order well her house and chamber.

桃之夭夭，其葉蓁蓁，之子于歸，宜其家人。

The peach tree is young and elegant;
Luxuriant are its leaves.
This young lady is going to her future home,
And will order well her family.
