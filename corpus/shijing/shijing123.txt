毛詩序：「《無衣》，刺晉武公也。武公始并晉國，其大夫為之請命乎天子之使，而作是詩也。」

國風‧唐‧無衣
豈曰無衣？七兮。不如子之衣，安且吉兮。

How can it be said that he is without robes?
He has those of the seven orders;
But it is better that he get those robes from you.
That will secure tranquillity and good fortune.

豈曰無衣？六兮。不如子之衣，安且燠兮。

How can it be said that he is without robes?
He has those of the six orders;
But it is better that he get those robes from you.
That will secure tranquillity and permanence.

《無衣》，二章，章三句。
