毛詩序：「《小毖》，嗣王求助也。」


小毖
予其懲，而毖後患。莫予荓蜂，自求辛螫。
肇允彼桃蟲，拚飛維鳥。未堪家多難，予又集于蓼。

I condemn myself [for the past], and will be on my guard against future calamity.
I will have nothing to do with a wasp,
To seek for myself its painful sting.
At first, indeed, the thing seemed but a wren,
But it took wing and became a [large] bird.
I am unequal to the many difficulties of the kingdom;
And I am placed in the midst of bitter experiences.


《小毖》，一章，八句。
