毛詩序：「《魚麗》，美萬物盛多能備禮也。文武以天保以上治內，《采薇》以下治外；始於憂勤，終於逸樂，故美萬物盛多，可以告於神明矣。」


魚麗
魚麗于罶，鱨鯊。君子有酒，旨且多。

The fish pass into the basket,
Yellow-jaws and sand-blowers.
Our host has spirits,
Good and abundance of them.

魚麗于罶，魴鱧。君子有酒，多且旨。

The fish pass into the basket,
Bream and tench.
Our host has spirits,
Abundance of them and good.

魚麗于罶，鰋鯉。君子有酒，旨且有。

The fish pass into the basket,
Mud-fish and carp.
Our host has spirits,
Good and in quantities.

物其多矣，維其嘉矣。

The viands are abundant,
And they are admirable.

物其旨矣，維其偕矣。

The viands are excellent,
Both from the land and the sea.

物其有矣，維其時矣。

The viands are in quantities,
And all in season.

《魚麗》，六章：三章，章四句；三章，章二句。
