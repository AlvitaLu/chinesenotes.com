毛詩序：「《狼跋》，美周公也。周公攝政，遠則四國流言，近則王不知周，大夫美其不失其聖也。」


狼跋
狼跋其胡，載疐其尾。公孫碩膚，赤舄几几。

The wolf springs forward on his dewlap,
Or trips back on his tail.
The duke was humble, and greatly admirable,
Self-composed in his red slippers.

狼疐其尾，載跋其胡。公孫碩膚，德音不瑕。

The wolf springs forward on his dewlap,
Or trips back on his tail.
The duke was humble, and greatly admirable,
There is no flaw in his virtuous fame.

《狼跋》，二章，章四句。
