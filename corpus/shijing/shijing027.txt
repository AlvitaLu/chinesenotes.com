毛詩序：「《柏舟》，言仁而不遇也。衞頃公之時，仁人不遇，小人在側。」

汎彼柏舟，亦汎其流。耿耿不寐，如有隱憂。 微我無酒，以敖以遊。

It floats about, that boat of cypress wood;
Yea, it floats about on the current.
Disturbed am I and sleepless,
As if suffering from a painful wound.
It is not because I have no wine,
And that I might not wander and saunder about.

我心匪鑒，不可以茹。 亦有兄弟，不可以據。薄言往愬，逢彼之怒。 

My mind is not a mirror; -
It cannot [equally] receive [all impressions].
I, indeed, have brothers,
But I cannot depend on them,
I meet with their anger.

我心匪石，不可轉也。我心匪席，不可卷也。 威儀棣棣，不可選也。

My mind is not a stone; -
It cannot be rolled about.
My mind is not a mat; -
It cannot be rolled up.
My deportment has been dignified and good,
With nothing wrong which can be pointed out.

憂心悄悄，慍于群小。 覯閔既多，受侮不少。靜言思之，寤辟有摽。 

My anxious heart is full of trouble;
I am hated by the herd of mean creatures;
I meet with many distresses;
I receive insults not a few.
Silently I think of my case,
And, starting as from sleep, I beat my breast.

日居月諸，胡迭而微？心之憂矣，如匪澣衣。 靜言思之，不能奮飛！

There are the sun and moon, -
How is it that the former has become small, and not the latter?
The sorrow cleaves to my heart,
Like an unwashed dress.
Silently I think of my case,
But I cannot spread my wings and fly away.

毛詩序：「《柏舟》，䘙世子共伯早死，其妻守節，父母欲奪而嫁之，誓而弗許，作此詩。」

柏舟
汎彼柏舟，在彼中河，髧彼兩髦，實維我儀，之死矢靡它，母也天只，不諒人只。
汎彼柏舟，在彼河側，髧彼兩髦，實維我特，之死矢靡慝，母也天只，不諒人只。

《柏舟》，二章，章七句。
