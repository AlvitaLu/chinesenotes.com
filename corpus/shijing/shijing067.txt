毛詩序：「《君子于役》，刺平王也。君子行役無期度，大夫思其危難以風焉」


君子于役
君子于役，不知其期。曷至哉？雞棲于塒，日之夕矣，羊牛下來。君子于役，如之何勿思！

My husband is away on service,
And I know not when he will return.
Where is he now?
The fowls roost in their holes in the walls;
And in the evening of the day,
The goats and cows come down [from the hill];
But my husband is away on service.
How can I but keep thinking of him?

君子于役，不日不月。曷其有佸？雞棲于桀，日之夕矣，羊牛下括。君子于役，苟無飢渴。

My husband is away on service,
Not for days [merely] or for months.
When will he come back to me?
The fowls roost on their perches;
And in the evening of the day,
The goats and cows come down and home;
But my husband is away on service.
Oh if he be but kept from hunger and thirst!

《君子于役》，二章，章八句。
