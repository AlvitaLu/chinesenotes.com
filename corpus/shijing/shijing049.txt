毛詩序：「《桑中》，刺奔也，衞之公室淫亂，男女相奔，至于世族在位，相竊妻妾，期於幽遠，政散民流，而不可止。」


桑中
爰采唐矣，沬之鄉矣，云誰之思，美孟姜矣，期我乎桑中，要我乎上宮，送我乎淇之上矣。

I am going to gather the dodder,
In the fields of Mei.
But of whom are my thoughts?
Of that beauty, the eldest of the Jiang.
She made an appontment with me in Sangzhong;
She will meet me in Shanggong;
She will accompany me to Qishang.

爰采麥矣，沬之北矣，云誰之思，美孟弋矣，期我乎桑中，要我乎上宮，送我乎淇之上矣。

I am going to gather the wheat,
In the north of Mei.
But of whom are my thoughts?
Of that beauty, the eldest of the Yi.
She made an appontment with me in Sangzhong;
She will meet me in Shanggong;
She will accompany me to Qishang.

爰采葑矣，沬之東矣，云誰之思，美孟庸矣，期我乎桑中，要我乎上宮，送我乎淇之上矣。

I am going to gather the mustard plant,,
In the east of Mei.
But of whom are my thoughts?
Of that beauty, the eldest of the Yong.
She made an appontment with me in Sangzhong;
She will meet me in Shanggong;
She will accompany me to Qishang.
