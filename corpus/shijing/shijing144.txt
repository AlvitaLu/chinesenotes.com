毛詩序：「《月出》，刺好色也。在位不好德而說美色焉。」


月出
月出皎兮，佼人僚兮，舒窈糾兮，勞心悄兮。

The moon comes forth in her brightness;
How lovely is that beautiful lady!
O to have my deep longings for her relieved!
How anxious is my toiled heart!

月出皓兮，佼人懰兮，舒懮受兮，勞心慅兮。

The moon comes forth in her splendour;
How attractive is that beautiful lady!
O to have my anxieties about her relieved!
How agitated is my toiled heart!

月出照兮，佼人燎兮，舒夭紹兮，勞心慘兮。

The moon comes forth and shines;
How brilliant is that beautiful lady!
O to have the chains of my mind relaxed!
How miserable is my toiled heart!

《月出》，三章，章四句。
