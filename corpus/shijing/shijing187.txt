毛詩序：「《庭燎》，美宣王也，因以箴之。」


庭燎
夜如何其？夜未央。庭燎之光，君子至止，鸞聲將將。

How goes the night?
It is not yet midnight.
The torch is blazing in the court-yard.
My princely men are arriving; -
There is the tinkling of their bells.

夜如何其？夜未艾。庭燎晣晣，君子至止，鸞聲噦噦。

How goes the night?
The night is not yet through.
The torch is growing pale in the court-yard.
My princely men are arriving; -
There is the sound of their bells, regular and near.

夜如何其？夜鄉晨。庭燎有煇，君子至止，言觀其旂。

How goes the night?
It is getting towards morning.
The torch is smoking in the court-yard.
My princely men are arriving; -
I see their banners.

《庭燎》，三章，章五句。
