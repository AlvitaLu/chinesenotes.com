毛詩序：「《羔裘》，刺朝也。言古之君子，以風其朝焉。」

國風‧鄭‧羔裘
羔裘如濡，洵直且侯。彼其之子，舍命不渝。

His lambs's fur is glossy,
Truly smooth and beautiful.
That officer,
Rests in his lot and will not change.

羔裘豹飾，孔武有力。彼其之子，邦之司直。

His lambs's fur, with its cuffs of leopard-skin.
Looks grandly martial and strong.
That officer,
In the country will ever hold to the right.

羔裘晏兮，三英粲兮。彼其之子，邦之彥兮。

How splendid is his lamb's fur!
How bright are its three ornaments!
That officer,
Is the ornament of the country.

《羔裘》，三章，章四句。
