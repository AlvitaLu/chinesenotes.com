毛詩序：「《敝笱》，刺文姜也。齊人惡魯桓公微弱，不能防閑文姜，使至淫亂，為二國患焉。」


敝笱
敝笱在梁，其魚魴鰥。齊子歸止，其從如雲。

Worn out is the basket at the dam,
And the fishes are the bream and the Guan,
The daughter of Qi has returned,
With a cloud of attendants.

敝笱在梁，其魚魴鱮。齊子歸止，其從如雨。

Worn out is the basket at the dam,
And the fishes are the bream and the tench,
The daughter of Qi has returned,
With a shower of attendants.

敝笱在梁，其魚唯唯。齊子歸止，其從如水。

Worn out is the basket at the dam,
And the fishes go in and out freely,
The daughter of Qi has returned,
With a stream of attendants.

《敝笱》，三章，章四句。
