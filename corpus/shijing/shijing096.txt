毛詩序：「《溱洧》，刺亂也。兵革不息，男女相棄，淫風大行，莫之能救焉。」


溱洧
溱與洧，方渙渙兮。士與女，方秉蕑兮。女曰觀乎，士曰既且。且往觀乎，洧之外，洵訏且樂。維士與女，伊其相謔。贈之以勺藥。

The Zhen and Wei,
Now present their broad sheets of water.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Are carrying flowers of valerian.
A lady says, ' Have you been to see? '
A gentleman replies, ' I have been. '
' But let us go again to see.
Beyond the Wei,
The ground is large and fit for pleasure. '
So the gentlemen and ladies.
Make sport together,
Presenting one another with small peonies.

溱與洧，瀏其清矣。士與女，殷其盈矣。女曰觀乎，士曰既且。且往觀乎，洧之外，洵訏且樂。維士與女，伊其將謔。贈之以勺藥。

The Zhen and Wei,
Show their deep, clear streams.
Gentlemen and ladies,
Appear in crowds.
A lady says, ' Have you been to see? '
A gentleman replies, ' I have been. '
' But let us go again to see.
Beyond the Wei,
The ground is large and fit for pleasure. '
So the gentlemen and ladies.
Make sport together,
Presenting one another with small peonies.

《溱洧》，二章，章十二句。
