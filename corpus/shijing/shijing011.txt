毛詩序
　　《汝墳》，道化行也。文王之化，行乎汝墳之國，婦人能閔其君子，猶勉之以正也。

詩文
遵彼汝墳，伐其條枚，未見君子，惄如調飢。

Along those raised banks of the Ru,
I cut down the branches and slender stems.
While I could not see my lord,
I felt as it were pangs of great hunger.

遵彼汝墳，伐其條肄，既見君子，不我遐棄。

Along those raised banks of the Ru,
I cut down the branches and fresh twigs.
I have seen my lord;
He has not cast me away.

魴魚赬尾，王室如燬，雖則如燬，父母孔邇。

The bream is showing its tail all red;
The royal House is like a blazing fire.
Though it be like a blazing fire,
Your parents are very near.

《汝墳》，三章，章四句。
