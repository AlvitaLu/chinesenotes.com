毛詩序：「《采苓》，刺晉獻公也。獻公好聽讒焉。」


采苓
采苓采苓，首陽之巔。人之為言，苟亦無信。舍旃舍旃，苟亦無然。人之為言，胡得焉！

Would you gather the liquorice, would you gather the liquorice,
On the top of Shouyang?
When men tell their stories,
Do not readily believe them;
Put them aside, put them aside.
Do not readily assent to them;
And, when men tell their stories,
How will they find course?

采苦采苦，首陽之下。人之為言，苟亦無與。舍旃舍旃，苟亦無然。人之為言，胡得焉！

Would you gather the sowthistle, would you gather the sowthistle,
At the foot of Shouyang?
When men tell their stories,
Do not readily approve them;
Put them aside, put them aside.
Do not readily assent to them;
And, when men tell their stories,
How will they find course?

采葑采葑，首陽之東。人之為言，苟亦無從。舍旃舍旃，苟亦無然。人之為言，胡得焉！

Would you gather the mustard plant, would you gather the mustard plant,
On the east of Shouyang?
When men tell their stories,
Do not readily listen to them; -
Put them aside, put them aside.
Do not readily assent to them;
And, when men tell their stories,
How will they find course?

《采苓》，三章，章八句。
