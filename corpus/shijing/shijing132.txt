毛詩序：「《黃鳥》，哀三良也。國人刺穆公以人從死，而作是詩也。」

國風‧秦‧黃鳥
交交黃鳥，止于棘。
誰從穆公？子車奄息。維此奄息，百夫之特。
臨其穴，惴惴其慄。
彼蒼者天，殲我良人！如可贖兮，人百其身。

They flit about, the yellow birds,
And rest upon the jujube trees.
Who followed duke Mu [to the grave]?
Ziche Yansi.
And this Yansi,
Was a man above a hundred.
When he came to the grave,
He looked terrified and trembled.
Thou azure Heaven there!
Thou art destroying our good men.
Could he have been redeemed,
We should have given a hundred lives for him.

交交黃鳥，止于桑。
誰從穆公？子車仲行。維此仲行，百夫之防。
臨其穴，惴惴其慄。
彼蒼者天，殲我良人！如可贖兮，人百其身。

They flit about, the yellow birds,
And rest upon the mulberry trees.
Who followed duke Mu [to the grave]?
Ziche Zhongheng.
And this Zhongheng,
Was a match for a hundred.
When he came to the grave,
He looked terrified and trembled.
Thou azure Heaven there!
Thou art destroying our good men.
Could he have been redeemed,
We should have given a hundred lives for him.

交交黃鳥，止于楚。
誰從穆公？子車鍼虎。維此鍼虎，百夫之禦。
臨其穴，惴惴其慄。
彼蒼者天，殲我良人！如可贖兮，人百其身。

They flit about, the yellow birds,
And rest upon the thorn trees.
Who followed duke Mu [to the grave]?
Ziche Qianhu.
And this Ziche Qianhu,
Could withstand a hundred men.
When he came to the grave,
He looked terrified and trembled.
Thou azure Heaven there!
Thou art destroying our good men.
Could he have been redeemed,
We should have given a hundred lives for him.
