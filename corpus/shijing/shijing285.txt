毛詩序：「《有瞽》，始作樂而合乎祖也。」


有瞽
有瞽有瞽，在周之庭。設業設虡，崇牙樹羽。應田縣鼓，鞉磬柷圉。
既備乃奏，簫管備舉。喤喤厥聲，肅雝和鳴，先祖是聽。
我客戾止，永觀厥成。

There are the blind musicians; there are the blind musicians;
In the court of [the temple of] Zhou.
There are [the music frames] with their face-boards and posts,
The high toothed-edge [of the former], and the feathers stuck [in the latter];
With the drums, large and small, suspended from them;
And the hand-drums and sounding-stones, the instrument to give the signal for commencing, and the stopper.
These being all complete, the music is struck up.
The pan-pipe and the double-flute begin at the same time.
Harmoniously blend their sounds;
In solemn unison they give forth their notes.
Our ancestors will give ear;
Our visitors will be there; -
Long to witness the complete performance.


《有瞽》，一章，十三句。
