毛詩序：「《葛生》，刺晉獻公也。好攻戰，則國人多喪矣。」


葛生
葛生蒙楚，蘞蔓于野。予美亡此，誰與獨處。

The dolichos grows, covering the thorn trees;
The convolvulus spreads all over the waste.
The man of my admiration is no more here;
With whom can I dwell? - I abide alone.

葛生蒙棘，蘞蔓于域。予美亡此，誰與獨息。

The dolichos grows, covering the jujube trees;
The convolvulus spreads all over the tombs.
The man of my admiration is no more here;
With whom can I dwell? - I rest alone.

角枕粲兮，錦衾爛兮。予美亡此，誰與獨旦。

How beautiful was the pillow of horn!
How splendid was the embroidered coverlet!
The man of my admiration is no more here; -
With whom can I dwell? - Alone [I wait for] the morning.

夏之日，冬之夜。百歲之後，歸于其居。

Through the [long] days of summer,
Through the [long] nights of winter [shall I be alone],
Till the lapse of a hundred years,
When I shall go home to his abode.

冬之夜，夏之日。百歲之後，歸于其室。

Through the [long] nights of winter,
Through the [long] days of summer [shall I be alone],
Till the lapse of a hundred years,
When I shall go home to his chamber.

《葛生》，五章，章四句。
