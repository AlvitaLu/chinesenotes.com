毛詩序：「《有客》，微子來見祖廟也。」


有客
有客有客，亦白其馬。有萋有且，敦琢其旅。
有客宿宿，有客信信。言授之縶，以縶其馬。[1]
薄言追之，左右綏之。既有淫威，降福孔夷。

The noble visitor! The noble visitor!
Drawn like his ancestors by white horses!
The revered and dignified,
Polished members of his suite!
The noble guest will stop [but] a night or two!
The noble guest will stop [but] two nights or four!
Give him ropes,
To bind his horses.
I will convoy him [with a parting feast];
I will comfort him in every possible way.
Adorned with such great dignity,
It is very natural that he should be blessed.

《有客》，一章，十二句。

註解
 宿宿，一作「㝛㝛」。
