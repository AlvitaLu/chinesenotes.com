毛詩序：「《隰有萇楚》，疾恣也。國人疾其君之淫恣，而思無情慾者也。」


隰有萇楚
隰有萇楚，猗儺其枝[1]。夭之沃沃，樂子之無知。

In the low wet grouds is the carambola tree;
Soft and pliant are its branches,
With the glossiness of tender beauty.
I should rejoice to be like you, [O tree], without consciousness.

隰有萇楚，猗儺其華。夭之沃沃，樂子之無家。

In the low, damp grounds is the carambola tree;
Soft and delicate are its flowers,
With the glossiness of its tender beauty.
I should rejoice to be like you, [O tree], without a family.

隰有萇楚，猗儺其實。夭之沃沃，樂子之無室。

In the low, damp grounds is the carambola tree;
Soft and delicate is its fruit,
With the glossiness of its tender beauty.
I should rejoice to be like you, [O tree], without a household.

《隰有萇楚》，三章，章四句。

註解
 猗儺，婀娜。柔順的樣子。
