毛詩序：「《漸漸之石》，下國刺幽王也。戎狄叛之，荊舒不至，乃命將率東征，役久病於外，故作是詩也。」


漸漸之石
漸漸之石，維其高矣。山川悠遠，維其勞矣。武人東征，不皇朝矣。

Those frowning rocks, -
How high they rise!
Over such a distance of hills and streams,
How toilsome is the march!
The warrior, in charge of the expedition to the east,
Has not a morning's leisure.

漸漸之石，維其卒矣。山川悠遠，曷其沒矣。武人東征，不皇出矣。

Those frowning rocks, -
How they crown the heights!
Over such a distance of hills and streams,
When shall we have completed our march?
The warrior, in charge of the expedition to the east,
Has no leisure [to think] how he wll withdraw.

有豕白蹢，烝涉波矣。月離于畢，俾滂沱矣。武人東征，不皇他矣。

There are swine, with their legs white,
All wading through streams.
The moon also is in the Hyades,
Which will bring still greater rain.
The warrior, in charge of the expedition to the east,
Has no leisure [to think] of anything but this.


《漸漸之石》，三章，章六句。
