毛詩序：「《蝃蝀》，止奔也。衞文公能以道化其民，淫奔之恥，國人不齒也。」


蝃蝀
蝃蝀在東，莫之敢指，女子有行，遠父母兄弟。

There is a rainbow in the east,
And no one dares to point to it.
When a girl goes away [from her home],
She separates from her parents and brothers.

朝隮于西，崇朝其雨，女子有行，遠兄弟父母。

In the morning [a rainbow] rises in the west,
And [only] during the morning is there rain.
When a girl goes away [from her home],
She separates from her brothers and parents.

乃如之人也，懷昏姻也，大無信也，不知命也。

This person
Has her heart only on being married.
Greatly is she untrue to herself,
And does not recognize [the law of] her lot.

《蝃蝀》，三章，章四句。
