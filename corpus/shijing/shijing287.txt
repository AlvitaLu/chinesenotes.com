毛詩序：「《雝》，禘大祖也。」


雝
有來雝雝，至止肅肅。相維辟公，天子穆穆。於薦廣牡，相予肆祀。
假哉皇考，綏予孝子。宣哲維人，文武維后。燕及皇天，克昌厥後。
綏我眉壽，介以繁祉。既右烈考，亦右文母。

They come full of harmony;
They are here, in all gravity; -
The princes assisting,
While the Son of Heaven looks profound.
'While I present [this] noble bull,
And they assist me in setting forth the sacrifice,
O great and august Father,
Comfort me, your filial Son!
'With penetrating wisdom thou did'st play the man,
A sovereign with the gifts both of peace and war,
Giving rest even to great Heaven,
And ensuring prosperity to thy descendants.
'Thou comfortest me with the eyebrows of longevity;
Thou makest me great with manifold blessings.
I offer this sacrifice to my meritorious father,
And to my accomplished mother. '


《雝》，一章，十六句。
