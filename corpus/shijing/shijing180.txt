毛詩序：「《彤弓》，天子錫有功諸侯也。」


彤弓
彤弓弨兮，受言藏之。我有嘉賓，中心貺之。鐘鼓既設，一朝饗之。

The red bows unbent,
Were received and deposited.
I have here an admirable guest,
And with all my heart I bestow one on him.
The bells and drums have been arranged in order,
And all the morning will I feast him.

彤弓弨兮，受言載之。我有嘉賓，中心喜之。鐘鼓既設，一朝右之。

The red bows unbent,
Were received and fitted on their frames.
I have here an admirable guest,
And with all my heart I rejoice in him.
The bells and drums have been arranged in order,
And all the morning will I honour him.

彤弓弨兮，受言櫜之。我有嘉賓，中心好之。鐘鼓既設，一朝醻之。

The red bows unbent,
Were received and placed in their cases.
I have here an admirable guest,
And with all my heart I love him.
The bells and drums have been arranged in order,
And all the morning will I pledge him.

《彤弓》，三章，章六句。
