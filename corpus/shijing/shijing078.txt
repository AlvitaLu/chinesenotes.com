毛詩序：「《叔于田》，刺莊公也。叔處于京，繕甲治兵，以出于田，國人說而歸之。」


叔于田
叔于田，巷無居人。豈無居人，不如叔也。洵美且仁。

Shu has gone hunting;
And in the streets there are no inhabitants.
Are there indeed no inhabitants?
[But] they are not like Shu,
Who is truly admirable and kind.

叔于狩，巷無飲酒。豈無飲酒，不如叔也。洵美且好。

Shu has gone to the grand chase;
And in the streets there are none feasting.
Are there indeed none feasting?
[But] they are not like Shu,
Who is truly admirable and good.

叔適野，巷無服馬。豈無服馬，不如叔也。洵美且武。

Shu has gone into the country;
And in the streets there are none driving about.
Are there indeed none driving about?
[But] they are not like Shu,
Who is truly admirable and martial.

《叔于田》，三章，章五句。
