毛詩序：「《谷風》，刺幽王也。天下俗薄，朋友道絕焉。」


小雅‧谷風之什‧谷風
習習谷風，維風及雨。
將恐將懼，維予與女。
將安將樂，女轉棄予。

Gently blows the east wind; -
The wind followed by the rain.
In the time of fear and dread,
It was all I and you.
In your time of rest and pleasure,
You have turned and cast me off.

習習谷風，維風及頹。
將恐將懼，寘予于懷。
將安將樂，棄予如遺。

Gently blows the east wind; -
And the wind is followed by the tornado.
In the time of fear and dread,
You placed me in your breast.
In your time of rest and pleasure,
You have cast me off like an abandoned thing.

習習谷風，維山崔嵬。
無草不死，無木不萎。
忘我大德，思我小怨。

Gently blows the east wind; -
And on the rock-covered tops of the hills.
There is no grass which is not dying,
No tree which is not withering.
You forget my great virtues,
And think of my small faults.

《谷風》，三章，章六句。
