呦呦鹿鳴，食野之苹。我有嘉賓，鼓瑟吹笙。
吹笙鼓簧，承筐是將。人之好我，示我周行。

With pleased sounds the deer call to one another,
Eating the celery of the fields.
I have here admirable guests;
The lutes are struck, and the organ is blown [for them]; -
The organ is blown till its tongues are all moving.
The baskets of offerings [also] are presented to them.
The men love me,
And will show me the perfect path.

呦呦鹿鳴，食野之蒿。我有嘉賓，德音孔昭。
視民不恌，君子是則是傚。我有旨酒，嘉賓式燕以敖。

With pleased sounds the deer call to one another,
Eating the southernwood of the fields.
I have here admirable guests;
Whose virtuous fame is grandly brilliant.
They show the people not to be mean;
The officers have in them a pattern and model.
I have good wine,
Which my admirable guests drink, enjoying themselves.

呦呦鹿鳴，食野之芩。我有嘉賓，鼓瑟鼓琴。
鼓瑟鼓琴，和樂且湛。我有旨酒，以燕樂嘉賓之心。

With pleased sounds the deer call to one another,
Eating the salsola of the fields.
I have here admirable guests;
For whom are struck the lutes, large and small.
The lutes, large and small, are struck,
And our harmonious joy is long-continued.
I have good wine,
To feast and make glad the hearts of my admirable guests.
