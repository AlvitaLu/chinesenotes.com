毛詩序：「《候人》，刺近小人也。共公遠君子而好近小人焉。」


候人
彼候人兮，何戈與祋。彼其之子，三百赤芾。

Those officers of escort,
Have their carriers of lances and halberds.
But these creatures,
With their three hundred red covers for the knees! -

維鵜在梁，不濡其翼。彼其之子，不稱其服。

The pelican is on the dam,
And will not wet his wings!
These creatures,
Are not equal to their dress!

維鵜在梁，不濡其咮。彼其之子，不遂其媾。

The pelican is on the dam,
And will not wet his beak!
These creatures,
Do not respond to the favour they enjoy.

薈兮蔚兮，南山朝隮。婉兮孌兮，季女斯飢。

Extensive and luxuriant is the vegetation,
And up the south hill in the morning rise the vapours.
Tender is she and lovely,
But the young lady is suffering from hunger.

《候人》，四章，章四句。
