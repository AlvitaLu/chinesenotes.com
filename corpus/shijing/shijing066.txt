毛詩序：「《黍離》，閔宗周也。周大夫行役，至于宗周，過故宗廟宮室，盡為禾黍。閔周室之顛覆，彷徨不忍去而作是詩也。」


黍離
彼黍離離，彼稷之苗。行邁靡靡，中心搖搖。知我者，謂我心憂，不知我者，謂我何求。悠悠蒼天，此何人哉！

There was the millet with its drooping heads;
There was the sacrificial millet coming into blade.
Slowly I moved about,
In my heart all-agitated.
Those who knew me,
Said I was sad at heart.
Those who did not know me,
Said I was seeking for something.
O distant and azure Heaven!
By what man was this [brought about]?

彼黍離離，彼稷之穗。行邁靡靡，中心如醉。知我者，謂我心憂，不知我者，謂我何求。悠悠蒼天，此何人哉！

There was the millet with its drooping heads;
There was the sacrificial millet in the ear.
Slowly I moved about,
My heart intoxicated, as it were, [with grief].
Those who knew me,
Said I was sad at heart.
Those who did not know me,
Said I was seeking for something.
O thou distant and azure Heaven!
By what man was this [brought about]?

彼黍離離，彼稷之實。行邁靡靡，中心如噎。知我者，謂我心憂，不知我者，謂我何求。悠悠蒼天，此何人哉！

There was the millet with its drooping heads;
There was the sacrificial millet in grain.
Slowly I moved about,
As if there were a stoppage at my heart.
Those who knew me,
Said I was sad at heart.
Those who did not know me,
Said I was seeking for something.
O thou distant and azure Heaven!
By what man was this [brought about]?

《黍離》，三章，章十句。
