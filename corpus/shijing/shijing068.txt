毛詩序：「《君子陽陽》，閔周也。君子遭亂，相招為祿仕，全身遠害而已。」


君子陽陽
君子陽陽，左執簧，右招我由房。其樂只且。

My husband looks full of satisfaction.
In his left hand he holds his reed-organ,
And with his right he calls me to the room.
Oh the joy!

君子陶陶，左執翿，右招我由敖。其樂只且。

My husband looks delighted.
In his left hand he holds his screen of feathers,
And with his right he calls me to the stage.
Oh the joy!

《君子陽陽》，二章，章四句。
