毛詩序：「《丘中有麻》，思賢也。莊王不明，賢人放逐，國人思之而作是詩也。」


丘中有麻
丘中有麻，彼留子嗟。彼留子嗟，將其來施施。

On the mound where is the hemp,
Some one is detaining Zijie.
Some one is there detaining Zijie; -
Would that he would come jauntily [to me]!

丘中有麥，彼留子國。彼留子國，將其來食。

On the mound where is the wheat,
Some one is detaining Ziguo.
Some one is there detaining Ziguo; -
Would that he would come and eat with me!

丘中有李，彼留之子。彼留之子，貽我佩玖。

On the mound where are the plum trees,
Some one is detaining those youths.
Some one is there detaining those youths; -
They will give me Jiu-stones for my girdle.

《丘中有麻》，三章，章四句。
