毛詩序
　　《兔罝》，后妃之化也。關雎之化行，則莫不好德，賢人衆多也。

詩文
肅肅兔罝，椓之丁丁，赳赳武夫，公侯干城。

Carefully adjusted are the rabbit nets;
Clang clang go the blows on the pegs.
That stalwart, martial man
Might be shield and wall to his prince.

肅肅兔罝，施于中逵，赳赳武夫，公侯好仇。

Carefully adjusted are the rabbit nets,
And placed where many ways meet.
That stalwart, martial man
Would be a good companion for his prince.

肅肅兔罝，施于中林，赳赳武夫，公侯腹心。

Carefully adjusted are the rabbit nets,
And placed in the midst of the forest.
That stalwart, martial man
Might be head and heart to his prince.
