毛詩序：「《旄丘》，責衞伯也。狄人迫逐黎侯，黎侯寓于衞，衞不能脩方伯連率之職，黎之臣子以責於衞也。」


旄丘
旄丘之葛兮，何誕之節兮，叔兮伯兮，何多日也。

The dolichos on that high and sloping mound; -
How wide apart are [now] its joints!
O ye uncles,
Why have ye delayed these many days?

何其處也，必有與也，何其久也，必有以也。

Why do they rest without stirring?
It must be they expect allies.
Why do they prolong the time?
There must be a reason for their conduct.

狐裘蒙戎，匪車不東，叔兮伯兮，靡所與同。

Our fox-furs are frayed and worn.
Came our carriages not eastwards?
O ye uncles,
You do not sympathize with us.

瑣兮尾兮，流離之子，叔兮伯兮，褎如充耳。

Fragments, and a remnant,
Children of dispersion [are we]!
O ye uncles,
Notwithstanding your full robes, your ears are stopped.


《旄丘》，四章，章四句。
