毛詩序：「《殷其靁》，勸以義也。召南之大夫遠行從政，不遑寧處。其室家能閔其勤勞，勸以義也。」

殷其靁
殷其靁，在南山之陽，何斯違斯，莫敢或遑，振振君子，歸哉歸哉。

Grandly rolls the thunder,
On the south of the southern hill!
How was it he went away from this,
Not daring to take a little rest?
My noble lord!
May he return! May he return!

殷其靁，在南山之側，何斯違斯，莫敢遑息，振振君子，歸哉歸哉。

Grandly rolls the thunder,
About the sides of the southern hill!
How was it he went away from this,
Not daring to take a little rest?
My noble lord!
May he return! May he return!

殷其靁，在南山之下，何斯違斯，莫或遑處，振振君子，歸哉歸哉。

Grandly rolls the thunder,
At the foot of the southern hill!
How was it he went away from this,
Not remaining a little at rest?
My noble lord!
May he return! May he return!

《殷其靁》，三章，章六句。
