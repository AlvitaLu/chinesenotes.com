毛詩序：「《桓》，講武類禡也。《桓》，武志也。」


桓
綏萬邦，婁豐年，天命匪解。
桓桓武王，保有厥士，于以四方。克定厥家。
於昭于天，皇以間之。

There is peace throughout our myriad regions;
There has been a succession of plentiful years:
Heaven does not weary in its favour.
The martial king Wu,
Maintained [the confidence of] his officers,
And employed them all over the kingdom,
So securing the establishment of his Family.
Oh! glorious was he in the sight of Heaven,
Which kinged him in the room [of Shang].


《桓》，一章，九句。
