毛詩序：「《卷阿》，召康公戒成王也。言求賢用吉士也。」


卷阿
有卷者阿，飄風自南。豈弟君子，來游來歌，以矢其音。[1]

Into the recesses of the large mound,
Came the wind whirling from the south.
There was [our] happy, courteous sovereign,
Rambling and singing;
And I took occasion to give forth my notes.

伴奐爾游矣，優游爾休矣。豈弟君子，俾爾彌爾性，似先公酋矣。

'Full of spirits you ramble;
Full of satisfaction you rest.
O happy and courteous sovereign,
May you fulfill your years,
And end them like your ancestors!

爾土宇昄章，亦孔之厚矣。豈弟君子，俾爾彌爾性，百神爾主矣。


Juan A:	
'Your territory is great and glorious,
And perfectly secure.
O happy and courteous sovereign,
May you fulfill your years,
As the host of all the Spirits!

爾受命長矣，茀祿爾康矣。豈弟君子，俾爾彌爾性，純嘏爾常矣。[2]

'You have received the appointment long-ackowledged,
With peace around your happiness and dignity.
O happy and courteous sovereign,
May you fulfill your years,
With pure happiness your constant possession!

有馮有翼，有孝有德，以引以翼。豈弟君子，四方為則。

'You have helpers and supporters,
Men of filial piety and of virtue,
To lead you on, and act as wings to you,
[So that], O happy and courteous sovereign,
You are a pattern to the four quarters [of the kingdom].

顒顒卬卬，如圭如璋，令聞令望。豈弟君子，四方為綱。

'Full of dignity and majesty [are they],
Like a jade-mace [in its purity],
The subject of praise, the contemplation of hope.
O happy and courteous sovereign,
[Through them] the four quarters [of the kingdom] are guided by you.

鳳皇于飛，翽翽其羽，亦集爰止。藹藹王多吉士，維君子使，媚于天子。

'The male and female phoenix fly about,
Their wings rustling,
While they settle in their proper resting place.
Many are your admirable officers, O king,
Ready to be employed by you,
Loving you, the son of Heaven.

鳳皇于飛，翽翽其羽，亦傅于天。藹藹王多吉人，維君子命，媚于庶人。

'The male and female phoenix fly about,
Their wings rustling,
As they soar up to heaven.
Many are your admirable officers, O king,
Waiting for your commands,
And loving the multitudes of the people.

鳳皇鳴矣，于彼高岡。梧桐生矣，于彼朝陽。菶菶萋萋，雝雝喈喈。[3]

'The male and female phoenix give out their notes,
On that lofty ridge.
The dryandras grow,
On those eastern slopes.
They grow luxuriantly;
And harmoniously the notes resound.

君子之車，既庶且多。君子之馬，既閑且馳。矢詩不多，維以遂歌。

'Your carriages, O sovereign,
Are many, many.
Your horses, O sovereign,
Are well trained and fleet.
I have made my few verses,
In prolongation of your song. '

《卷阿》，十章：六章，章五句；四章，章六句。
