毛詩序：「《苕之華》，大夫閔時也。幽王之時，西戎東夷，交侵中國，師旅並起，因之以饑饉。君子閔周室之將亡，傷己逢之，故作是詩也。」


苕之華
苕之華，芸其黃矣。心之憂矣，維其傷矣。

The flowers of the bignonia,
Are of a deep yellow.
My heart is sad;
I feel its wound.

苕之華，其葉青青。知我如此，不如無生。

The flowers of the bignonia [are gone],
[There are only] its leaves all-green.
If I had known it would be thus with me,
I had better not have been born.

牂羊墳首，三星在罶。人可以食，鮮可以飽。

The ewes have large heads;
The Three stars are [seen] in the fish-trap.
If some men can get enough to eat,
Few can get their fill.

《苕之華》，三章，章四句。
