毛詩序：「《還》，刺荒也。哀公好田獵，從禽獸而無厭，國人化之，遂成風俗，習於田獵，謂之賢，閑於馳逐，謂之好焉。」


還
子之還兮，遭我乎峱之閒兮。並驅從兩肩兮？揖我謂我儇兮。

How agile you are!
You met me in the neighbourhood of Nao,
And we pursued together two boars of three years.
You bowed to me, and said that I was active.

子之茂兮，遭我乎峱之道兮。並驅從兩牡兮？揖我謂我好兮。

How admirable your skill!
You met me in the way to Nao,
And we drove together after two males.
You bowed to me, and said that I was skilful.

子之昌兮，遭我乎峱之陽兮。並驅從兩狼兮？揖我謂我臧兮。

How complete your art!
You met me on the south of Nao,
And we pursued together two wolves.
You bowed to me, and said that I was dexterous.

《還》，三章，章四句。
