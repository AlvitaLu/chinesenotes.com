毛詩序：「《木瓜》，美齊桓公也。衞國有狄人之敗，出處于漕，齊桓公救而封之，遺之車馬器服焉，衞人思之，欲厚報之，而作是詩也。」



木瓜
投我以木瓜，報之以瓊琚，匪報也，永以為好也。

There was presented to me a papaya,
And I returned for it a beautiful Ju-gem;
Not as a return for it,
But that our friendship might be lasting.

投我以木桃，報之以瓊瑤，匪報也，永以為好也。

There was presented to me a peach,
And I returned for it a beautiful Yao-gem;
Not as a return for it,
But that our friendship might be lasting.

投我以木李，報之以瓊玖，匪報也，永以為好也。

There was presented to me a plum,
And I returned for it a beautiful Jiu-gem;
Not as a return for it,
But that our friendship might be lasting.
