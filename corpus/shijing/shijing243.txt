毛詩序：「《棫樸》，文王能官人也。」


棫樸
芃芃棫樸，薪之槱之。濟濟辟王，左右趣之。

Abundant is the growth of the yu and the pu,
Supplying firewood; yea, stores of it.
Elegant and dignified was our prince and king;
On the right and the left they hastened to him.

濟濟辟王，左右奉璋。奉璋峨峨，髦士攸宜。

Elegant and dignified was our prince and king;
On his left and his right they bore their half-mace [libation-cups]; -
They bore their instruments with solemn gravity,
As beseemed such eminent officers.

淠彼涇舟，烝徒楫之。周王于邁，六師及之。

They rush along, - those boats on the Jing.
All the rowers labouring at their oars.
The king of Zhou marched on,
Followed by his six hosts.

倬彼雲漢，為章于天。周王壽考，遐不作人。

Vast is that Milky Way,
Making a brilliant figure in the sky.
Long years did the king of Zhou enjoy; -
Did he not exert an influence upon men?

追琢其章，金玉其相。勉勉我王，綱紀四方。

Engraved and chiselled are the ornaments;
Of metal and of jade is their substance.
Ever active was our king,
Giving law and rules to the four quarters [of the kingdom].


《棫樸》，五章，章四句。
