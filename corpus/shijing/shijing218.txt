毛詩序：「《瞻彼洛矣》，刺幽王也。思古明王，能爵命諸侯，賞善罰惡焉。」


瞻彼洛矣
瞻彼洛矣，維水泱泱。君子至止，福祿如茨。韎韐有奭，以作六師。

Look at the Luo,
With its waters broad and deep.
Thither has come our lord,
In whom all happiness and dignity are concentrated.
Red are his madder-dyed knee covers,
In which he might raise his six armies.

瞻彼洛矣，維水泱泱。君子至止，鞸琫有珌。君子萬年，保其家室。[1]

Look at the Luo,
With its waters broad and deep.
Thither has our lord come,
The gems at his scabbard's mouth all-gleaming.
May our lord live myriads of years,
Preserving his House!

瞻彼洛矣，維水泱泱。君子至止，福祿既同。君子萬年，保其家邦。

Look at the Luo,
With its waters broad and deep.
Thither has our lord come,
In whom all happiness and dignities are united.
May our lord live myriads of years,
Preserving his clans and States!


《瞻彼洛矣》，三章，章六句。
