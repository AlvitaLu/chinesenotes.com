毛詩序：「《裳裳者華》，刺幽王也。古之仕者世祿，小人在位，則讒諂並進，棄賢者之類，絕功臣之世焉。」


裳裳者華
裳裳者華，其葉湑兮。我覯之子，我心寫兮。我心寫兮，是以有譽處兮。

Splendid are the flowers,
And the leaves are luxuriant.
I see these princes,
And my heart is entirely satisfied.
My heart is entirely satisfied.
Right is it they should have praise and prosperity!

裳裳者華，芸其黃矣。我覯之子，維其有章矣。維其有章矣，是以有慶矣。

Splendid are the flowers,
And deep is their yellow.
I see these princes,
Full of all elegance.
They are full of all elegance; -
Right is it they should have every blessing!

裳裳者華，或黃或白。我覯之子，乘其四駱。乘其四駱，六轡沃若。

Splendid are the flowers,
Some yellow, some white.
I see these princes,
Drawn by their four white steeds, black-maned.
They are drawn by their four white steeds, black-maned.
And the six reins are glossy!

左之左之，君子宜之。右之右之，君子有之。維其有之，是以似之。

To the left [they move], to the left,
And they execute the movement properly.
To the right [they move], to the right,
And they execute the movement properly.
They are possessed of the ability,
And right is it their movements should indicate it.


《裳裳者華》，四章，章六句。
