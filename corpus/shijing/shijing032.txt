毛詩序：「《擊鼓》，怨州吁也。衞州吁用兵暴亂，使公孫文仲將而平陳與宋，國人怨其勇而無禮也。」


擊鼓
擊鼓其鏜，踴躍用兵，土國城漕，我獨南行。

Hear the roll of our drums!
See how we leap about, using our weapons!
Those do the fieldwork in the State, or fortify Cao,
While we alone march to the south.

從孫子仲，平陳與宋，不我以歸，憂心有忡。

We followed Sun Zizhong,
Peace having been made with Chen and Song;
[But] he did not lead us back,
And our sorrowful hearts are very sad.

爰居爰處，爰喪其馬，于以求之，于林之下。

Here we stay, here we stop;
Here we lose our horses;
And we seek for them,
Among the trees of the forest.

死生契闊，與子成說，執子之手，與子偕老。

For life or for death, however separated,
To our wives we pledged our word.
We held their hands; -
We were to grow old together with them.

于嗟闊兮，不我活兮，于嗟洵兮，不我信兮。

Alas for our separation!
We have no prospect of life.
Alas for our stipulation!
We cannot make it good.

《擊鼓》，五章，章四句。
