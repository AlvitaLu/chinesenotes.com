毛詩序：「《干旄》，美好善也。衞文公臣子多好善賢者，樂告以善道也。」


干旄
孑孑干旄，在浚之郊，素絲紕之，良馬四之，彼姝者子，何以畀之。

Conspiciously rise the staffs with their ox-tails,
In the distant suburbs of Jun,
Ornamented with the white silk bands;
There are four carriages with their good horses,
That admirable gentleman, -
What will he give them [for his]?

孑孑干旟，在浚之都，素絲組之，良馬五之，彼姝者子，何以予之。

Conspiciously rise the staffs with their falcon-banners,
In the nearer suburbs of Jun,
Ornamented with the white silk ribbons;
There are four carriages with their good horses,
That admirable gentleman, -
What will he give them [for his]?

孑孑干旌，在浚之城，素絲祝之，良馬六之，彼姝者子，何以告之。

Conspiciously rise the staffs with their feathered streamers,
At the walls of Jun,
Bound with the white silk cords;
There are six carriages with their good horses,
That admirable gentleman, -
What will he give them [for his]?

《干旄》，三章，章六句。
