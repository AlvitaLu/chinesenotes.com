毛詩序：「《何草不黃》，下國刺幽王也。四夷交侵，中國背叛，用兵不息，視民如禽獸。君子憂之，故作是詩也。」


何草不黃
何草不黃？何日不行？何人不將？經營四方。

Every plant is yellow;
Every day we march.
Every man is moving about,
Doing service in some quarter of the kingdom.

何草不玄？何人不矜？哀我征夫，獨為匪民。

Every plant is purple;
Every man is torn from his wife.
Alas for us employed on these expeditions!
How are we alone dealt with as if we were not men?

匪兕匪虎，率彼曠野。哀我征夫，朝夕不暇。

We are not rhinoceroses, we are not tigers,
To be kept in these desolate wilds.
Alas for us employed on these expeditions!
Morning and night we have no leisure.

有芃者狐，率彼幽草。有棧之車，行彼周道。

The long-tailed foxes,
May keep among the dark grass.
And our box-carts,
Keep moving along the great roads.

《何草不黃》，四章，章四句。
