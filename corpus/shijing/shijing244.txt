毛詩序：「《旱麓》，受祖也。周之先祖，世脩后稷公劉之業，大王王季申以百福干祿焉。」


旱麓
瞻彼旱麓，榛楛濟濟。豈弟君子，干祿豈弟。

Look at the foot of the Han,
How abundantly grow the hazel and the arrow-thorn!
Easy and self-possessed was our prince,
In his pursuit of dignity [still] easy and self-possessed!

瑟彼玉瓚，黃流在中。豈弟君子，福祿攸降。

Massive is that libation-cup of jade,
With the yellow liquid [sparkling] in it.
Easy and self-possessed was our prince,
The fit recipient of blessing and dignity.

鳶飛戾天，魚躍于淵。豈弟君子，遐不作人。

The hawk flies up to heaven;
The fishes leap in the deep.
Easy and self-possessed was our-prince; -
Did he not exert an influence upon men?

清酒既載，騂牡既備。以享以祀，以介景福。

His clear spirits are in vessel;
His red bull is ready; -
To offer, to sacrifice,
To increase his bright happiness.

瑟彼柞棫，民所燎矣。豈弟君子，神所勞矣。

Thick grow the oaks and the yu,
Which the people use for fuel.
Easy and self-possessed was our prince,
Cheered and encouraged by the Spirits.

莫莫葛藟，施于條枚。豈弟君子，求福不回。

Luxuriant are the dolichos and other creepers,
Clinging to the branches and stems,
Easy and self-possessed was our prince,
Seeking for happiness by no crooked ways.


《旱麓》，六章，章四句。
