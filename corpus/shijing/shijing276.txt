毛詩序：「《昊天有成命》，郊祀天地也。」


昊天有成命
昊天有成命，二后受之。
成王不敢康，夙夜基命宥密。
於緝熙！單厥心。肆其靖之。

Heaven made its determinate appointment,
Which [our] two sovereigns received.
King Cheng did not dare to rest idly in it.
But night and day enlarged its foundations by his deep and silent virtue.
How did he continue and glorify [his heritage],
Exerting all his heart,
And so securing its tranquillity!


《昊天有成命》，一章，七句。
