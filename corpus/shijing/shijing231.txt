毛詩序：「《采綠》，刺怨曠也。幽王之時，多怨曠者也。」


采綠
終朝采綠，不盈一匊。予髮曲局，薄言歸沐。

All the morning I gather the king-grass,
And do not collect enough to fill my hands.
My hair is in a wisp; -
I will go home and wash it.

終朝采藍，不盈一襜。五日為期，六日不詹。

All the morning I gather the indigo plant,
And do not collect enough to fill my apron.
Five days was the time agreed on; -
It is the sixth, and I do not see him.

之子于狩，言韔其弓。之子于釣，言綸之繩。

When he went a hunting,
I put the bow in its case for him.
When he went to fish,
I arranged his line for him.

其釣維何？維魴及鱮。維魴及鱮，薄言觀者。

What did he take in angling?
Bream and tench; -
Bream and tench,
While people [looked on] to see.

《采綠》，四章，章四句。
