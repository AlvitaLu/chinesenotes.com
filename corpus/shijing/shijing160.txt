毛詩序：「《九罭》，美周公也。周大夫刺朝廷之不知也。」


九罭
九罭之魚，鱒魴。我覯之子，袞衣繡裳。

In the net with its nine bags,
Are rud and bream.
We see this prince,
With his grand-ducal robe and embroidered skirt.

鴻飛遵渚，公歸無所。於女信處。

The wild geese fly [only] about the islets.
The duke is returning; - is it not to his proper place?
He was stopping with you [and me] but for a couple of nights.

鴻飛遵陸，公歸不復。於女信宿。

The wild geese fly about the land.
The duke is returning, and will not come back here?
He was lodging with you [and me] but for a couple of nights.

是以有袞衣兮，無以我公歸兮，無使我心悲兮。

《九罭》，四章：一章四句；三章，章三句。
