毛詩序：「《著》，刺時也。時不親迎也。」


著
俟我於著乎而，充耳以素乎而，尚之以瓊華乎而。

He was waiting for me between the door and the screen.
The strings of his ear-stoppers were of white silk,
And there were appended to them beautiful Hua-stones.

俟我於庭乎而，充耳以青乎而，尚之以瓊瑩乎而。

He was waiting for me in the open court.
The strings of his ear-stoppers were of green silk,
And there were appended to them beautiful Ying-stones.

俟我於堂乎而，充耳以黃乎而，尚之以瓊英乎而。

He was waiting for me in the hall.
The strings of his ear-stoppers were of yellow silk,
And there were appended to them beautiful Ying-stones.

《著》，三章，章三句。
