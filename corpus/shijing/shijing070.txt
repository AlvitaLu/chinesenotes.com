毛詩序：「《中谷有蓷》，閔周也。夫婦日以衰薄，凶年饑饉，室家相棄爾。」


中谷有蓷
中谷有蓷，暵其乾矣。有女仳離，嘅其嘆矣。嘅其嘆矣！遇人之艱難矣！

In the valleys grows the mother-wort,
But scorched is it in the drier places.
There is a woman forced to leave her husband;
Sadly she sighs!
Sadly she sighs!
She suffers from his hard lot.

中谷有蓷，暵其脩矣。有女仳離，條其歗矣。條其歗矣！遇人之不淑矣！

In the valleys grows the mother-wort,
But scorched is it where it had become long.
There is a woman forced to leave her husband;
Long-drawn are her groanings!
Long-drawn are her groanings!
She suffers from his misfortune.

中谷有蓷，暵其濕矣。有女仳離，啜其泣矣。啜其泣矣！何嗟及矣！

In the valleys grows the mother-wort,
But scorched is it even in the moist places.
There is a woman forced to leave her husband;
Ever flow her tears!
Ever flow her tears!
But of what avail is her lament?

《中谷有蓷》，三章，章六句。
