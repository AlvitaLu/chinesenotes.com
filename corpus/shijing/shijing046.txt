毛詩序：「《柏舟》，䘙世子共伯早死，其妻守節，父母欲奪而嫁之，誓而弗許，作此詩。」

柏舟
汎彼柏舟，在彼中河，髧彼兩髦，實維我儀，之死矢靡它，母也天只，不諒人只。

It floats about, that boat of cypress wood,
There in the middle of the He.
With his two tufts of hair falling over his forehead,
He was my mate;
And I swear that till death I will have no other.
O mother, O Heaven,
Why will you not understand me?

汎彼柏舟，在彼河側，髧彼兩髦，實維我特，之死矢靡慝，母也天只，不諒人只。

It floats about, that boat of cypress wood,
There by the side of the He.
With his two tufts of hair falling over his forehead,
He was my only one;
And I swear that till death I will not do the evil thing.
O mother, O Heaven,
Why will you not understand me?
