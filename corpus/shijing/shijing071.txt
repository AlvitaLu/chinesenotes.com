毛詩序：「《兔爰》，閔周也。桓王失信，諸侯背叛，構怨連禍，王師傷敗，君子不樂其生焉。」


兔爰
有兔爰爰，雉離于羅。我生之初，尚無為。我生之後，逢此百罹，尚寐無吪？

The hare is slow and cautious;
The pheasant plumps into the net.
In the early part of my life,
Time still passed without commotion.
In the subsequent part of it,
We are meeting with all these evils.
I wish I might sleep and never wake more.

有兔爰爰，雉離于罦。我生之初，尚無造。我生之後，逢此百憂，尚寐無覺？

The hare is slow and cautious;
The pheasant plumps into the snare.
In the early part of my life,
Time still passed without anything stirring.
In the subsequent part of it,
We are meeting with all these sorrows.
I wish I might sleep and never move more.

有兔爰爰，雉離于罿。我生之初，尚無庸。我生之後，逢此百凶，尚寐無聦！

The hare is slow and cautious;
The pheasant plumps into the trap.
In the early part of my life,
Time still passed without any call for our services.
In the subsequent part of it,
We are meeting with all these miseries.
I would that I might sleep, and hear of nothing more.
