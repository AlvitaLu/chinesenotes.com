毛詩序：「《菁菁者莪》，樂育材也。君子能長育人材，則天下喜樂之矣。」


菁菁者莪
菁菁者莪，在彼中阿，既見君子，樂且有儀。

Luxuriantly grows the aster-southernwood,
In the midst of that large mound.
Since we see our noble lord,
We rejoice, and he shows us all courtesy.

菁菁者莪，在彼中沚，既見君子，我心則喜。

Luxuriantly grows the aster-southernwood,
In the midst of that islet.
Since we see our noble lord,
Our hearts are full of joy.

菁菁者莪，在彼中陵，既見君子，錫我百朋。

Luxuriantly grows the aster-southernwood,
In the midst of that great height.
We see our noble lord,
And he gives us a hundred sets of cowries.

汎汎楊舟，載沈載浮，既見君子，我心則休。

It floats about, - the willow boat,
Now sinking, now rising again.
Since we see our noble lord,
Our hearts are at rest.

《菁菁者莪》，四章，章四句。
