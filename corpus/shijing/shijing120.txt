毛詩序：「《杕杜》，刺時也。君不能親其宗族，骨肉離散，獨居而無兄弟，將為沃所并爾。」

國風‧唐‧杕杜
有杕之杜，其葉湑湑。獨行踽踽，豈無他人？不如我同父，嗟行之人，胡不比焉？人無兄弟，胡不佽焉？

There is a solitary russet pear tree,
[But] its leaves are luxuriant.
Alone I walk unbefriended; -
Is it because there are no other people?
But none are like the sons of one's father.
O ye travellers,
Why do ye not sympathize with me?
Without brothers as I am,
Why do ye not help me?

有杕之杜，其葉菁菁。獨行睘睘，豈無他人？不如我同姓，嗟行之人，胡不比焉？人無兄弟，胡不佽焉？

There is a solitary russet pear tree,
[But] its leaves are abundant.
Alone I walk uncared for; -
Is it that there are not other people?
But none are like those of one's own surname.
O ye travellers,
Why do ye not sympathize with me?
Without brothers as I am,
Why do ye not help me?
