毛詩序：「《清人》，刺文公也。高克好利而不顧其君，文公惡而欲遠之。不能，使高克將兵而禦狄于竟。陳其師旅，翱翔河上，久而不召，衆散而歸。高克奔陳。公子素惡高克，進之不以禮，文公退之不以道，危國亡師之本。故作是詩也。」


清人
清人在彭，駟介旁旁。二矛重英，河上乎翱翔。

The men of Qing are in Peng;
The chariot with its team in mail ever moves about;
The two spears in it, with their ornaments, rising, one above the other.
So do they roam about the He.

清人在消，駟介麃麃。二矛重喬，河上乎逍遙。

The men of Qing are in Xiao;
The chariot with its team in mail looks martial;
And the two spears in it, with their hooks, rise one above the other.
So do they saunter about by the He.

清人在軸，駟介陶陶。左旋右抽，中軍作好。

The men of Qing are in Zhou;
The mailed team of the chariot prance proudly.
[The driver] on the left wheels it about, and [the spearman] on the right brandishes his weapon,
While the general in the middle looks pleased.

《清人》，三章，章四句。
