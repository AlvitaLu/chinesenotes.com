毛詩序：「《汾沮洳》，刺儉也。其君儉以能勤，刺不得禮也。」


汾沮洳
彼汾沮洳，言采其莫。彼其之子，美無度；美無度，殊異乎公路。

There in the oozy grounds of the Fen,
They gather the sorrel.
That officer,
Is elegant beyond measure.
He is elegant beyond measure.
But, perhaps, he is not what the superintendent of the ruler's carriages ought to be.

彼汾一方，言采其桑。彼其之子，美如英；美如英，殊異乎公行。

There along the side of the Fen,
They gather the mulberry leaves.
That officer,
Is elegant as a flower.
He is elegant as a flower;
But, perhaps, he is not what the marshaller of the carriages ought to be.

彼汾一曲，言采其藚。彼其之子，美如玉；美如玉，殊異乎公族。

There along the bend of the Fen,
They gather the ox-lips.
That officer,
Is elegant as a gem.
He is elegant as a gem;
But, perhaps, he is not what the superintendent of the ruler's relations should be.

《汾沮洳》，三章，章六句。
