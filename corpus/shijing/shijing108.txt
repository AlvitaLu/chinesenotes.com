毛詩序：「《葛屨》，刺褊也。魏地陿隘，其民機巧趨利。其君儉嗇褊急，而無德以將之。」


葛屨
糾糾葛屨，可以履霜。摻摻女手，可以縫裳。要之襋之，好人服之。

Shoes thinly woven of the dolichos fibre,
May be used to walk on the hoarfrost.
The delicate fingers of a bride,
May be used in making clothes.
[His bride] puts the waistband to his lower garment and the collar to his upper,
And he, a wealthy man, wears them.

好人提提，宛然左辟。佩其象揥。維是褊心，是以為刺。

Wealthy, he moves about quite at ease,
And politely he stands aside to the left.
From his girdle hangs his ivory comb-pin.
It is the narrowness of his disposition,
Which makes him a subject for satire.

《葛屨》二章：一章六句，一章五句。
