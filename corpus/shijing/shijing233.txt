毛詩序：「《隰桑》，刺幽王也。小人在位，君子在野。思見君子，盡心以事之。」


隰桑
隰桑有阿，其葉有難。既見君子，其樂如何？

In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,
And their leaves are luxuriant.
When I see the princely men,
How great is the pleasure!

隰桑有阿，其葉有沃。既見君子，云何不樂？

In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,
And their leaves are glossy.
When I see the princely men,
How can I be other than glad?

隰桑有阿，其葉有幽。既見君子，德音孔膠。

In the low, wet grounds, the mulberry trees are beautiful,
And their leaves are dark.
When I see the princely men,
Their virtuous fame draws them close [to my heart].

心乎愛矣，遐不謂矣？中心藏之，何日忘之？

In my heart I love them,
And why should I not say so?
In the core of my heart I keep them,
And never will forget them.

《隰桑》，五章，章四句。
