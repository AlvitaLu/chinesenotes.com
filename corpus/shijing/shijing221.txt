毛詩序：「《鴛鴦》，刺幽王也。思古明王交於萬物有道，自奉養有節焉。」


鴛鴦
鴛鴦于飛，畢之羅之。君子萬年，福祿宜之。

The Yellow ducks fly about,
And are taken with hand-nets and spread-nets.
May our sovereign live for ten thousand years,
Enjoying the happiness and wealth which are his due!

鴛鴦在梁，戢其左翼。君子萬年，宜其遐福。

The Yellow ducks are on the dam,
With their left wings gathered up.
May our sovereign live for ten thousand years,
Enjoying the happiness and wealth which are his due!

乘馬在廏，摧之秣之。君子萬年，福祿艾之。

The teams of steeds are in the stable,
Fed with forage and grain.
May our sovereign live for ten thousand years,
Sustained in his happiness and wealth!

乘馬在廏，秣之摧之。君子萬年，福祿綏之。

The teams of steeds are in the stable,
Fed with grain and forage.
May our sovereign live for ten thousand years,
In the comfort of his happiness and wealth!


《鴛鴦》，四章，章四句。
