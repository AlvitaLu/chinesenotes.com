毛詩序：「《東門之墠》，刺亂也。男女有不待禮而相奔者也。」


東門之墠
東門之墠，茹藘在阪。其室則邇，其人甚遠。

Near the level ground at the east gate,
Is the madder plant on the bank.
The house is near there,
But the man is very far away.

東門之栗，有踐家室。豈不爾思？子不我即。

By the chestnut trees at the east gate,
Is a row of houses.
Do I not think of you?
But you do not come to me.

《東門之墠》，二章，章四句。
