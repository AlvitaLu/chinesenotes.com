毛詩序：「瓠葉，大夫刺幽王也。上棄禮而不能行，雖有牲牢饔餼，不肯用也。故思古之人，不以微薄廢禮焉。」[1]


瓠葉
幡幡瓠葉，采之亨之。君子有酒，酌言嘗之。

Of the gourd leaves, waving about,
Some are taken and boiled;
[Then] the superior man, from his spirits,
Pours out a cup, and tastes it.

有兔斯首，炮之燔之。君子有酒，酌言獻之。

There is but a single rabbit,
Baked, or roasted.
[But] the superior man, from his spirits,
Fills the cup and presents it [to his guests].

有兔斯首，燔之炙之。君子有酒，酌言酢之。

There is but a single rabbit,
Roasted, or broiled.
[But] from the spirits of the superior man,
[His guests] fill the cup, and present it to him.

有兔斯首，燔之炮之。君子有酒，酌言醻之。

There is but a single rabbit,
Roasted, or baked.
[But] from the spirits of the superior man,
[His guests and he] fill the cup and pledge one another.


《瓠葉》，四章，章四句。
