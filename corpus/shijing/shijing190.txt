毛詩序：「《祈父》，刺宣王也。」


祈父
祈父！予王之爪牙，胡轉予于恤？靡所止居。

Minister of war,
We are the claws and teeth of the king.
Why have you rolled us into this sorrow,
So that we have no abiding place?

祈父！予王之爪士，胡轉予于恤？靡所厎止。

Minister of war,
We are the taloned soldiers of the king.
Why have you rolled us into this sorrow,
So that there is no end [of our toils]?

祈父！亶不聦，胡轉予于恤？有母之尸饔。

Minister of war,
You have indeed acted without discrimination.
Why have you rolled us into this sorrow,
So that our mothers have to do all the labour of cooking?


《祈父》，三章，章四句。
