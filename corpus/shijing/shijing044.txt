毛詩序：「《新臺》，刺衞宣公也，納伋之妻，作新臺于河上而要之。國人惡之，而作是詩也。」

新臺
新臺有泚，河水瀰瀰，燕婉之求，蘧篨不鮮。

Fresh and bright is the New Tower,
On the waters of the He, wide and deep.
A pleasant, genial mate she sought,
[And has got this] vicious bloated mass!

新臺有洒，河水浼浼，燕婉之求，蘧篨不殄。

Lofty is the New Tower,
On the waters of the He, flowing still.
A pleasant, genial mate she sought,
[And has got this] vicious bloated mass!

魚網之設，鴻則離之，燕婉之求，得此戚施。

It was a fish net that was set,
And a goose has fallen into it.
A pleasant, genial mate she sought,
And she has got this hunchback.

《新臺》，三章，章四句。
