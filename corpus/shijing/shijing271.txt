毛詩序：「《清廟》，祀文王也。周公既成洛邑，朝諸侯，率以祀文王焉。」


清廟
於穆清廟，肅雝顯相。
濟濟多士，秉文之德。
對越在天，駿奔走在廟。
不顯不承，無射於人斯。

Ah! solemn is the ancestral temple in its pure stillness.
Reverent and harmonious were the distinguished assistants;
Great was the number of the officers:
[All] assiduous followers of the virtue of [king] Wen.
In response to him in heaven,
Grandly they hurried about in the temple.
Distinguished is he and honoured,
And will never be wearied of among men.


《清廟》，一章，八句。
