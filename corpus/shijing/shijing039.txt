毛詩序：「《簡兮》，刺不用賢也。衞之賢者仕於伶官，皆可以承事王者也。」


簡兮
簡兮簡兮，方將萬舞，日之方中，在前上處，

Easy and indifferent! easy and indifferent!
I am ready to perform in all dances,
Then when the sun is in the meridian,
There in that conspicious place.

碩人俁俁，公庭萬舞。有力如虎，執轡如組，

With my large figure,
I dance in the ducal courtyard.
I am strong [also] as a tiger;
The reins are in my grasp like ribbons.

左手執籥，右手秉翟，赫如渥赭，公言錫爵。

In my left hand I grasp a flute;
In my right I hold a pheasant's feather.
I am red as if I were rouged;
The duke gives me a cup [of spirits].

山有榛，隰有苓，云誰之思，西方美人，彼美人兮，西方之人兮。

The hazel grows on the hills,
And the liquorice in the marshes.
Of whom are my thoughts?
Of the fine men of the west.
O those fine men!
Those men of the west!

《簡兮》，三章，章六句。
