毛詩序：「《東方未明》，刺無節也。朝廷興居無節，號令不時，挈壺氏不能掌其職焉。」


東方未明
東方未明，顛倒衣裳。顛之倒之，自公召之。

Before the east was bright,
I was putting on my clothes upside down;
I was putting them on upside down,
And there was one from the court calling me.

東方未晞，顛倒裳衣。倒之顛之，自公令之。

Before there was a streak of dawn in the east,
I was putting on my clothes upside down;
I was putting them on upside down,
And there was one from the court with orders for me.

折柳樊圃，狂夫瞿瞿。不能辰夜，不夙則莫。

You fence your garden with branches of willow,
And the reckless fellows stand in awe.
He, [however], cannot fix the time of night;
If he be not too early, he is sure to be late.

《東方未明》，三章，章四句。
