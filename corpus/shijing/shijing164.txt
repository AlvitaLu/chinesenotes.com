毛詩序：「《皇皇者華》，君遣使臣也。送之以禮樂，言遠而有光華也。」


皇皇者華
皇皇者華，于彼原隰。駪駪征夫，每懷靡及。

Brilliant are the flowers,
On those level heights and the low grounds.
Complete and alert is the messenger, with his suite,
Ever anxious lest he should not succeed.

我馬維駒，六轡如濡。載馳載驅，周爰咨諏。

My horses are young;
The six reins look as if they were moistened.
I gallop them, and urge them on,
Everywhere pushing my inquiries.

我馬維騏，六轡如絲。載馳載驅，周爰咨謀。

My horses are piebald;
The six reins are like silk.
I gallop them, and urge them on,
Everywhere seeking information and counsel.

我馬維駱，六轡沃若。載馳載驅，周爰咨度。

My horses are white and black-maned;
The six reins look glossy.
I gallop them, and urge them on,
Everywhere seeking information and advice.

我馬維駰，六轡既均。載馳載驅，周爰咨詢。

My horses are grey;
The six reins are well in hand.
I gallop them, and urge them on,
Everywhere seeking information and suggestions.


《皇皇者華》，五章，章四句。
