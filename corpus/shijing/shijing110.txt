毛詩序：「《園有桃》，刺時也。大夫憂其君國小而迫，而儉以嗇，不能用其民。而無德教，日以侵削，故作是詩也。」


園有桃
園有桃，其實之殽。心之憂矣，我歌且謠。不知我者，謂我士也驕。彼人是哉，子曰何其？心之憂矣！其誰知之？其誰知之？蓋亦勿思！

Of the peach trees in the garden,
The fruit may be used as food.
My heart is grieved,
And I play and sing.
Those who do not know me,
Say I am a scholar venting his pride.
'Those men are right;
What do you mean by your words?'
My heart is grieved;
Who knows [the cause of] it?
Who knows [the cause of] it?
[They know it not], because they will not think.

園有棘，其實之食。心之憂矣，聊以行國。不我知者，謂我士也罔極。彼人是哉，子曰何其？心之憂矣！其誰知之？其誰知之？蓋亦勿思！

Of the jujube trees in the garden,
The fruit may be used as food.
My heart is grieved,
And I think I must travel about through the State.
Those who do not know me,
Say I am an officer going to the verge of license.
' Those men are right;
What do you mean by your words? '
My heart is grieved;
Who knows [the cause of] it?
Who knows [the cause of] it?
[They do not know it], because they will not think.

《園有桃》，二章，章十二句。
