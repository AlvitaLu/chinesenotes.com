毛詩序：「《蓼莪》，刺幽王也。民人勞苦，孝子不得終養爾。」


蓼莪
蓼蓼者莪，匪莪伊蒿。
哀哀父母，生我劬勞。

Long and large grows the e; -
It is not the e but the hao.
Alas! alas! my parents,
With what toil ye gave me birth!

蓼蓼者莪，匪莪伊蔚。
哀哀父母，生我勞瘁。

Long and large grows the e; -
It is not the e but the wei.
Alas! alas! my parents,
With what toil and suffering ye gave me birth!

缾之罄矣，維罍之恥。
鮮民之生，不如死之久矣。
無父何怙？無母何恃？
出則銜恤，入則靡至。

When the pitcher is exhausted,
It is the shame of the jar.
Than to live an orphan,
It would be better to have been long dead.
Fatherless, who is there to rely on?
Motherless, who is there to depend on?
When I go abroad, I carry my grief with me;
When I come home, I have no one to go to.

父兮生我，母兮鞠我，拊我、畜我、長我、育我、
顧我、復我、出入腹我。欲報之德，昊天罔極。

O my father, who begat me!
O my mother, who nourished me!
Ye indulged me, ye fed me,
Ye held me up, ye supported me,
Ye looked after me, ye never left me,
Out and in ye bore me in your arms.
If I would return your kindness,
It is like great Heaven, illimitable,

南山烈烈，飄風發發。
民莫不穀，我獨何害？

Cold and bleak is the Southern hill;
The rushing wind is very fierce.
People all are happy; -
Why am I alone thus miserable?

南山律律，飄風弗弗。
民莫不穀，我獨不卒！

The Southern hill is very steep;
The rushing wind is blustering.
People all are happy; -
I alone have been unable to finish [my duty].


《蓼莪》六章：四章，章四句；二章，章八句。

註解
成氏曰：毛詩之序言此諷幽王之意，民之言此，時不則予，何哉？實則郢書燕說之疑焉
