毛詩序：「《出其東門》，閔亂也。公子五爭，兵革不息，男女相棄，民人思保其室家焉。」


出其東門
出其東門，有女如雲。雖則如雲，匪我思存。縞衣綦巾，聊樂我員。

I went out at the east gate,
Where the girls were in clouds.
Although they are like clouds,
It is not on them that my thoughts rest.
She in the thin white silk, and the grey coiffure, -
She is my joy!

出其闉闍，有女如荼。雖則如荼，匪我思且。縞衣茹藘，聊可與娛。

I went out by the tower on the covering wall,
Where the girls were like flowering rushes.
Although they are like flowering rushes,
It is not of them that I think.
She in the thin white silk, and the madder-[dyed coiffure], -
It is she that makes me happy!

《出其東門》，二章，章六句。
