毛詩序：「《無衣》，刺用兵也。秦人刺其君，好攻戰亟用兵，而不與民同欲焉。」

國風‧秦‧無衣
豈曰無衣？與子同袍。王于興師，脩我戈矛，與子同仇。

How shall it be said that you have no clothes?
I will share my long robes with you.
The king is raising his forces;
I will prepare my lance and spear,
And will be your comrade.

豈曰無衣？與子同澤。王于興師，脩我矛戟，與子偕作。

How shall it be said that you have no clothes?
I will share my under clothes with you.
The king is raising his forces;
I will prepare my spear and lance,
And will take the field with you.

豈曰無衣？與子同裳。王于興師，脩我甲兵，與子偕行。

How shall it be said that you have no clothes?
I will share my lower garments with you.
The king is raising his forces;
I will prepare my buffcoat and sharp weapons,
And will march along with you.

《無衣》，三章，章五句。
