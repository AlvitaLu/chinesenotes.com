毛詩序：「《大車》，刺周大夫也。禮義陵遲，男女淫奔，故陳古以刺今，大夫不能聽男女之訟焉。」


大車
大車檻檻，毳衣如菼。豈不爾思，畏子不敢。

His great carriage rumbles along,
And his robes of rank glitter like the young sedge.
Do I not think of you?
But I am afraid of this officer, and dare not.

大車啍啍，毳衣如璊。豈不爾思，畏子不奔。

His great carriage moves heavily and slowly,
And his robes of rank glitter like a carnation-gem.
Do I not think of you?
But I am afraid of this officer, and do not rush to you.

穀則異室，死則同穴。謂予不信，有如皦日。

While living, we may have to occupy different apartments;
But when dead, we shall share the same grave.
If you say that I am not sincere,
By the bright sun I swear that I am.

《大車》，三章，章四句。
