毛詩序：「《緜蠻》，微臣刺亂也。大臣不用仁心，遺忘微賤，不肯飲食教載之，故作是詩也。」


緜蠻
緜蠻黃鳥，止于丘阿。道之云遠，我勞如何！
飲之食之，教之誨之。命彼後車，謂之載之。

There is that little oriole,
Resting on a bend of the mound.
The way is distant,
And I am very much wearied.
Give me drink, give me food;
Inform me, teach me;
Order one of the attending carriages,
And tell them to carry me.

緜蠻黃鳥，止于丘隅。豈敢憚行？畏不能趨。
飲之食之，教之誨之。命彼後車，謂之載之。

There is that little oriole,
Resting on a corner of the mound.
It is not that I dare to shrink from the journey,
But I am afraid of not being able to go on.
Give me drink, give me food;
Inform me, teach me;
Order one of the attending carriages,
And tell them to carry me.

緜蠻黃鳥，止于丘側。豈敢憚行，畏不能極。
飲之食之，教之誨之。命彼後車，謂之載之。

There is that little oriole,
Resting on the side of the mound.
It is not that I dare to shrink from the journey,
But I am afraid of not getting to the end of it.
Give me drink, give me food;
Inform me, teach me;
Order one of the attending carriages,
And tell them to carry me.

《緜蠻》，三章，章八句。
