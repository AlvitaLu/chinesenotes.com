毛詩序：「《相鼠》，刺無禮也。衞文公能正其羣臣而刺在位，承先君之化，無禮儀也。」


相鼠
相鼠有皮，人而無儀，人而無儀，不死何為。

Look at a rat, - it has its skin;
But a man should be without dignity of demeanour.
If a man have no dignity of demeanour,
What should he but die?

相鼠有齒，人而無止，人而無止，不死何俟。

Look at a rat, - it has its teeth;
But a man shall be without any right deportment.
If a man have not right deportment,
What should he wait for but death?

相鼠有體，人而無禮，人而無禮，胡不遄死。

Look at a rat, - it has its limbs;
But a man shall be without any rules of propriety.
If a man observe no rules of propriety,
Why does he not quickly die?

《相鼠》，三章，章四句。
