毛詩序：「《下泉》，思治也。曹人疾共公侵刻下民，不得其所，憂而思明王賢伯也。」


下泉
洌彼下泉，浸彼苞稂。愾我寤嘆，念彼周京。

Cold come the waters down from that spring,
And overflow the bushy wolf's-tail grass,
Ah me! I awake and sigh,
Thinking of that capital of Zhou.

洌彼下泉，浸彼苞蕭。愾我寤嘆，念彼京周。

Cold come the waters down from that spring,
And overflow the bushy southernwood,
Ah me! I awake and sigh,
Thinking of that capital of Zhou.

洌彼下泉，浸彼苞蓍。愾我寤嘆，念彼京師。

Cold come the waters down from that spring,
And overflow the bushy divining plants,
Ah me! I awake and sigh,
Thinking of that capital-city.

芃芃黍苗，陰雨膏之。四國有王，郇伯勞之。

Beautifully grew the fields of young millet,
Enriched by fertilizing rains.
The States had their sovereign,
And there was the chief of Xun to reward their princes.

《下泉》，四章，章四句。
