毛詩序：「《碩鼠》，刺重斂也。國人刺其君重斂蠶食於民，不脩其政，貪而畏人，若大鼠也。」


碩鼠
碩鼠碩鼠，無食我黍！三歲貫女[1]，莫我肯顧。逝將去女，適彼樂土。樂土樂土，爰得我所。

Large rats! Large rats!
Do not eat our millet.
Three years have we had to do with you,
And you have not been willing to show any regard for us.
We will leave you,
And go to that happy land.
Happy land! Happy land!
There shall we find our place.

碩鼠碩鼠，無食我麥！三歲貫女，莫我肯德。逝將去女，適彼樂國。樂國樂國，爰得我直。

Large rats! Large rats!
Do not eat our wheat.
Three years have we had to do with you,
And you have not been willing to show any kindness to us.
We will leave you,
And go to that happy State.
Happy State! Happy State!
There shall we find ourselves right.

碩鼠碩鼠，無食我苗！三歲貫女，莫我肯勞。逝將去女，適彼樂郊。樂郊樂郊，誰之永號。

Large rats! Large rats!
Do not eat our springing grain!
Three years have we had to do with you,
And you have not been willing to think of our toil.
We will leave you,
And go to those happy borders.
Happy borders! Happy borders!
Who will there make us always to groan?

《碩鼠》，三章，章八句。

注釋
 女，通汝，即「你」之意。
