毛詩序：「《菀柳》，刺幽王也。暴虐無親而刑罰不中，諸侯皆不欲朝，言王者之不可朝事也。」


菀柳
有菀者柳，不尚息焉？上帝甚蹈，無自暱焉。俾予靖之，後予極焉。

There is a luxuriant willow tree; -
Who would not wish to rest [under it]?
[But this] god is very changeable; -
Do not approach him.
If I were to [try and] order his affairs,
His demands afterwards would be extreme.

有菀者柳，不尚愒焉？上帝甚蹈，無自瘵焉。俾予靖之，後予邁焉。

There is a luxuriant willow tree; -
Who would not wish to take shelter [under it]?
[But this] god is very changeable,
Do not get yourself into trouble with him.
If I were to [try and] order his affairs,
His demands on me afterwards would be beyond measure.

有鳥高飛，亦傅于天。彼人之心，于何其臻？曷予靖之？居以凶矜。

There is a bird flying high,
Even up to heaven.
The heart of that man, -
To what will it proceed?
Why should I [try to] order his affairs?
I should only find myself in pitiable misery.


《菀柳》，三章，章六句。
