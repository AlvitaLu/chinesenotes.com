      <h3 class='article'><a name='bi'></a>Using 比 to Express Comparison</h3>
      <p>
        The preposition 比 can be used to express the difference in nature or degree of two people or objects. The basic form is:
      </p>
      <p>
        Person or thing to compare (subject) + 比 person or thing to compare (adverbial adjunct) + predicate
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>丝绸比棉花漂亮。 Silk is more pretty than cotton.
          <p>
            (The adverbial adjunct 比棉花 modifies the predicate 漂亮 comparing the degree of beauty of 丝绸 and 棉花.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>朝阳区的房子比宣武区的房子贵。 Homes in Chaoyang District are more expensive than homes in Xuanwu District.
          <p>
             (The preposition 比 and the endocentric phrase 宣武区的房子 form a prepositional phrase. which acts as the adverbial adjunct.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>这辆车比那辆车快一点。 This car is a little faster than that one.
          <p>
            (When the difference is small then complements of quantity, such as 一点 and 一些 are often used.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>一天比一天好。 Every day is better than the last.
          <p>
            (To express progress the following form can be used: 一 + measure word + 比 一 + measure word + predicate.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='gen'></a>Using 跟 to Express Comparison</h3>
      <p>
        The preposition 跟 can also be used to express the diferences and similarities between two people or objects. Use 跟 to explain whether two people or things are or are not the same. Use 比 to describe the difference more specifically. The basic form of such a sentence is:
      </p>
      <p>
        Person or thing to compare (subject) + 跟 Person or thing to compare (adverbial adjunct) + predicate
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>我跟你一样。 I am the same as you.
          <p>
            (The pronoun 我 acts as the subject, the prepositional phrase 跟你 is the adverbial adjunct, and the adjective 一样 is the predicate.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>这杯茶的味道跟那被的差不多。 The flavor of this cup of tea and that cup are nearly the same.
          <p>
            (Frequently used predicate adjectives include, 一样、差不多、and 相同.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='xiang'></a>Using 象 to Express Comparison</h3>
      <p>
        The verb 象 can be used to express that two people or object resemble one another. The basic form is:
      </p>
      <p>
        Person or thing (Subject) + 象 (predicate) + Person or thing (object)
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>他象一个小丑。 He looks like a clown.
          <p>
            (The verb 象 is used to compare the subject 他 and the object of the sentence 小丑.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>你象你妈妈那么爱心。 You are so compassionate, just like your mother.
          <p>
            (The verb 象, the endocentric phrase 你妈妈, and the demonstrative pronoun 那么 form the adverbial adjunct 象你妈妈那么. The adjective 爱心 acts as the predicate.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
