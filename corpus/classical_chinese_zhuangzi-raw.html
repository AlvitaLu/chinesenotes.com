      <h3 class='article'>Selections from Zhuang Zi</h3>
      <p>
        Zhuang Zi 莊子 (369-286 BCE) was an influential Taoist philosopher who
        lived during the Warring States Period 戰國時代. He was born in the City
        of Meng 蒙城 in the state of Song. He lived during the reign of
        King Hui of Wei 魏惠王 (reign 370—319 BCE).

        Taoist philosophy 道家 is a school of thought based primary on the
        books Dao De Jing 道德經 by Lao Zi 老子 and Zhuang Zi 莊子. Taoism 道教
        as a religion is connected with Taoist philosophy but also includes
        many Chinese folk traditions. Some modern writers do not identify 
        Zhuang Zi with Taoism.

        Zhuang Zi's writings are collected into a book of the same name.
        The English translations here are based on The Writings
        of Chuang Tzu by James Legge (Legge, 1891) with both English and Chinese
        made available online by the Chinese Text Project.

        A Fabulous Bird
      </h4>
      <h5>《秋水》</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        惠子相梁，莊子往見之。或謂惠子曰：「莊子來，欲代子相。」於是惠子恐，搜於國中三日三夜。莊子往見之，曰：「南方有鳥，其名為鵷鶵，子知之乎？夫鵷鶵發於南海而飛於北海，非梧桐不止，非練實不食，非醴泉不飲。於是鴟得腐鼠，鵷鶵過之，仰而視之曰：『嚇！』今子欲以子之梁國而嚇我邪？」

      <h5>From: The Floods of Autumn</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        Huizi was a minister in Liang.
        Zhuang Zi went to see him.
        Some one had told Huizi that Zhuangzi was come with a wish to supersede
        him in his office.
        Huizi became afraid, and instituted a search for the Zhuangzi thoughout
        the state for three days 
        and three nights.
        Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “There is a fabulous bird in the
        south of China called a yuanchu.  
        Do you know it?”
        Starting from the South China Sea the yuanchu flies to the Bohai Sea.
        Now, if it does not find 
        Chinese parasol it will not rest.  It will only eat bamboo seeds 
        [Cheng Xuanying says that lianshi are bamboo seeds.
        Wu Tingxu says that lian is a loan character for practice.]
        and only drink from the purest springs.
        Once an owl caught a rotten rat. When the yuanchu went passing overhead
        the owl looked up to it 
        and gave an angry scream.
        Today, do you also wish to use the kingdom of Liang to frighten me with
        a scream?
        Yao Nai says that this language shows the vulgar nature of Zhuang Zi's
        disciples.

       Dragging One's Tail in the Mud
      </h4>
      <h5>《秋水》</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        莊子釣於濮水，楚王使大夫二人往先焉，曰：「願以境內累矣！」莊子持竿不顧，曰：「吾聞楚有神龜，死已三千歲矣，王巾笥而藏之廟堂之上。此龜者，寧其死為留骨而貴乎，寧其生而曳尾於塗中乎？」二大夫曰：「寧生而曳尾塗中。」莊子曰：「往矣！吾將曳尾於塗中。」

      <h5>From: The Floods of Autumn</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        Zhuang Zi was fishing in the Pu River.
        The king of Chu sent two second level ministers to him, with the
        message, “I wish to burden you with the charge of my territories.”
        Zhuangzi held his rod and, without looking around, said, “I have heard
        that in Chu there is a spirit-like tortoise-shell, the wearer of which
        died 3000 years ago. The king keeps it in his ancestral temple, in a
        bamboo box covered with cloth. Was it better for the tortoise to die,
        and leave its shell to be thus honoured? Or would it have been better
        for it to live, and keep on dragging its tail through the mud?”
        The two officers said, “It would have been better for it to live, and
        draw its tail through the mud.” Zhuang Zi said, “Go then. I will keep on
        drawing my tail through the mud.”

        The Skull
      </h4>
      <h5>至樂</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        莊子之楚，見空髑髏，髐然有形，撽以馬捶，因而問之曰：「夫子貪生失理，而為此乎？將子有亡國之事，斧鉞之誅，而為此乎？將子有不善之行，愧遺父母妻子之醜，而為此乎？將子有凍餒之患，而為此乎？將子之春秋故及此乎？」於是語卒，援髑髏枕而臥。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        夜半，髑髏見夢曰：「子之談者似辯士。視子所言，皆生人之累也，死則無此矣。子欲聞死之說乎？」莊子曰：「然。」髑髏曰：「死，無君於上，無臣於下，亦無四時之事，從然以天地為春秋，雖南面王樂，不能過也。」莊子不信，曰：「吾使司命復生子形，為子骨肉肌膚，反子父母妻子、閭里、知識，子欲之乎？」髑髏深矉蹙頞曰：「吾安能棄南面王樂而復為人間之勞乎？」

      <h5>From: Perfect Enjoyment</h5>
      <p class='example'>
        When Zhuang Zi went to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached but still
        retaining its shape. Tapping it with his horse-switch, he asked it,
        saying, “Did you, Sir, in your greed of life, fail in the lessons of
        reason, and come to this? Or did you die, in the service of a perishing
        state, by execution? Or was it through your evil conduct, reflecting
        disgrace on your parents and on your wife and children?
        Or was it through your hard endurances of cold and hunger?
        Or was it that you had completed your term of life?”
        Having given expression to these questions, he took up the skull, and
        made a pillow of it when he went to sleep.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        At midnight the skull appeared to him in a dream, and said, 
        “What you said to me was after the fashion of an orator.
        All your words were about the entanglements of men in their lifetime.
        There are none of those things after death.
        Would you like to hear me, Sir, tell you about death?”
        “I would,” said Zhuang Zi.
        The skull resumed, “In death there are not (the distinctions of) ruler
        above and minister below. There are none of the phenomena of the four
        seasons. Tranquil and at ease, our years are those of heaven and earth.
        No king in his court has greater enjoyment than 
        we have.”
        Zhuang Zi did not believe it and said, “If I could get the Ruler of our
        Destiny to restore your body to life with its bones and flesh and skin,
        and to give you back your father and mother, your wife and children, and
        all your village acquaintances, would you wish me to do so?”
        The skull stared fixedly at him, knitted its brows, and said, “How
        should I cast away the enjoyment of my royal court, and undertake again
        the toils of life among mankind?”
