        在位于伊斯兰堡市的一所寂静清真寺巴基斯坦军队和学生之间的对峙进入第二个晚上。还有一千多人躲在这座清真寺里。美国站记者搜德在伊斯兰堡报道得说清真寺的首席神职人员在男扮女装试图逃跑的时候被警察抓获。经过两天十二紧张的暴力冲突之后星期三晚上红色清真寺的此外情况发生了意想不到的变化。巴基斯坦信息技术与电信部长塔利克阿期木说警察抓获了清真寺的首席神职人员阿期自。他被抓获时明显是向藏在一群妇女当中流出去。
      </p>
      <p>
        [Azim] .. and we suspected there was somebody whose movements were not
        exactly women-like.  So when we checked up he was trying to escape ...
      </p>
      <p>
        阿期木说《我们看到有的人的行动不太像女人。我们检察的时候发现他是偷穿着伊斯兰妇女的长袍逃走。》阿期木说这位支持塔利班而且臭名招徒的玩忽派神职人员当场被抓获。星期三政府命令激进分子放下武器否则他们会面临进一步的攻击。在这之后大约有七百名男女投降。然而政府官员说清真寺里仍然有一千多名核心激进分子等待着下一轮可能的攻击。尽管清真寺七月有二十四小时宵禁而且据报道实行了停火，星期三依然可以在清真寺附近听到枪声。整个清真寺地区的电源被切断。巴基斯坦军队动用了装甲车并设着了铁丝网以封锁附近区域。阿期木说政府依然希望避免前面冲突...
      </p>
      <p>
        [Azim] We still hope that common sense will prevail and they will
        surrender, realizing that they've got no other option left to them now
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        阿期木说“我们依然希望理智能够发挥作用，激进分子能够投降，能够意识到除此之外他们别无选择。”星期二在清真寺发生的冲突造成十一人死亡。伊斯兰堡市的大部份地区实际上实行了解严。战斗是在于青学生冲向一个政府安全部门之后暴发的。很多学生实用了竹制球棒和手枪作武器。政府官员说几个学生开枪打死至少一位警察之后，警察向人群发射了催泪瓦斯。这次流血冲突是在清真寺的塔利班支持者和巴基斯坦政府对峙了几个月之后暴发的。红色清真寺的领袖要强制实施严格的伊斯兰法律，正如十年前塔利班政权在阿富汗实施的法律那样。清真寺里的学生在伊斯兰堡市发动了以色列的挑衅刑袭击包括几次绑架地方警察和一些据称的妓女。政府不但威胁说要报复激进分子行为但是星期二之前政府为了通过谈判解决问题一再做出让步。这次冲突暴发之际巴基斯坦总统穆沙拉夫面对持续上升政治反对。今天晚间的时候巴基斯坦想举行选举，许多批评穆沙拉夫的人斗笠用红色清真寺的对质来强调他们对政府在控制宗教激进分子方面失败的忧虑。

        In a quiet mosque in Islamabad the confrontation between Pakistan troops
        and students entered the second night. There are still more than a
        thousand people hiding in the mosque. US based journalist Saunders in
        Islamabad reported that a clergy was dressed in women's clothing trying
        to flee when they were arrested by the police.  After two and a half
        days of tense violent conflict on Wednesday night at the Red Mosque 
        an unexpected change occurred. The Pakistan Information Technology and
        Telecommunications Terik Azim said that when the police arrested the
        clergy Aziz.  At the time he was arrested he was obviously trying to 
        slip out by hiding amongst a crowd of women.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Azim] .. and we suspected there was somebody whose movements were not
        exactly women-like.  So when we checked up he was trying to escape ...
      </p>
      <p>
        [Announcer] Azim said, "We suspected there was somebody whose movements
        were not exactly women-like.  When 
        we checked we found that he was wearing a woman's dress trying to 
        escape." Azim went on to say that this supporter of the Taliban,
        notorious recruiter, and Wahabi Sect leader was arrested on the spot. On
        Wednesday the government ordered the radicals to lay down their weapons
        or face a heightened offensive.  After that about seven hundred men and
        women surrendered.  However, a government official said that there were
        still over a thousand core radicals waiting for the next possible round
        of attacks. Although during July the Mosque has had a 24 hour curfew
        and, according to reports, a cease fire has been implemented, on
        Wednesday the sound of gunfire could still be heard. The power supply
        for the entire mosque area was cut off.  Pakistan troops used an armored
        car to erect barbed wire in order to seal the immediate area. 
        Azim said that although the government hopes to avoid direct conflict ...
      </p>
      <p>
        [Azim] We still hope that common sense will prevail and they will surrender, realizing that 
        they've got no other option left to them now ...
      </p>
      <p>
        [Announcer] Azim said, "We still hope that common sense will prevail and
        they will surrender realizing that they have no other option left to
        them."  The violence on Tuesday led to the deaths of eleven people. In 
        most of the city of Istanbul restrictions have been lifted.  The
        fighting broke out after students rushed a government security
        department.  Many students used cricket bats and pistols as weapons.
        A government official said that after several students shot and killed
        at least one policeman that the police fired tear gas into the crowd.
        This bloody conflict comes several months after Taliban supporters at
        the mosque opposed the government.  The Red Mosque leaders want to
        forcefully implement strict Islamic law, as ten years ago when the
        Taliban had power in Afghanistan. The students in Islamabad initiated 
        attacks to punish Israelli provocation, including kidnapping local
        police and some supposed prostitutes. Despite the fact that the
        government threatened to retaliate for the actions of the radicals, for
        the purpose of using negotiations to solve the problem, they repeatedly
        make concessions. The present erruption of violence has Pakistan
        President Musharraf facing sustained increasing political opposition.
        This evening as Pakistan considered holding elections, many Musharraf
        critics used the Red Mosque confrontation to emphasize their concern
        over the government's defeat in control over religious radicals.
