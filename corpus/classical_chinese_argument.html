        This page describes forms of argument in early Chinese writing. 
        This subject is somewhat similar to rhetoric in classical Greek and 
        Latin in the sense of describing tools for the persuation of readers.
        For a more detailed introduction see Gentz and Meyer (2015).

      <h4>Initial Fu 夫</h4>
      <p>
        Phrase status markers in Chinese are similar to English phrases like 
        “in principle”, “let me add”, “on the contrary”. Initial fú 夫 is a
        phrase status marker in literary Chinese to mark the beginning of a
        new topic or point of an argument. It is one of the markers that have been used
        to add puncuation or new lines to classical Chinese manuscripts that
        were written as a continuous stream of characters. Initial fú 夫
        is especially common in texts from the Warring States period to the
        Third Century CE. Wagner chooses Wang Bi's (226-249) commentaries on the
        Zhouyi and Daode Jing for his study of this function word
        (Wagner 2015, p. 37).
        Other simila function words that are used to open phrases are
        惟 'but,', 蓋 'because',  and 故 'therefore'.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of initial fu from Wagner (2015, p. 43) from Wang Bi's
        commentary on the <i>Zhouyi</i> is
      </p>
      <p>
        夫陰之所求者陽也<br/>
        Fu, that what the <i>yin</i> is striving after is the <i>yang</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more details on Initial fú 夫 see Wagner (2015).

      <h4>Coordination, Subordination, and Parallelism</h4>
      <p>
        A common pattern in early Chinese texts is pairs of sequences of 
        characters in equal numbers. This is termed 排比 <i>parallelism</i>, which
        is a conspicious in 律詩 regulated verse (Plaks 2015, p. 67). It is also
        a form used in Chinese prose, albeit with a rhythmic flow, where it is 
        called 駢體文 <i>parallel prose</i>. The pairs
        Various coordination-subordination relations are possible,
        commonly 對偶 opposites, 相對 complements, or
        coordination-subordination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plaks gives an example from 大學 <i>Great Learning</i>
        (Plaks 2015, p. 67):
      </p>
      <p>
        身有所忿懥，則不得其正<br/>
        When one's personal relations are governed by animosity and resentment,
        then one is incapable of achieving straightness of mind.
