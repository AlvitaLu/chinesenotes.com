      <h3>Forms of Argument</h3>
      <p>
        This page describes forms of argument in early Chinese writing. 
        This subject is somewhat similar to rhetoric in classical Greek and 
        Latin in the sense of describing tools for the persuation of readers.
        For a more detailed introduction see Gentz and Meyer (2015).

      <h4>Initial Fu 夫</h4>
      <p>
        Phrase status markers in Chinese are similar to English phrases like 
        “in principle”, “let me add”, “on the contrary”. Initial fú 夫 is a
        phrase status marker in literary Chinese to mark the beginning of a
        new topic or point of an argument. It is one of the markers that have been used
        to add puncuation or new lines to classical Chinese manuscripts that
        were written as a continuous stream of characters. Initial fú 夫
        is especially common in texts from the Warring States period to the
        Third Century CE. Wagner chooses Wang Bi's (226-249) commentaries on the
        Zhouyi and Daode Jing for his study of this function word
        (Wagner 2015, p. 37).
        Other simila function words that are used to open phrases are
        惟 'but,', 蓋 'because',  and 故 'therefore'.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of initial fu from Wagner (2015, p. 43) from Wang Bi's
        commentary on the Zhouyi is
      </p>
      <p>
        夫陰之所求者陽也<br/>
        Fu, that what the <i>yin</i> is striving after is the <i>yang</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more details on Initial fú 夫 see Wagner (2015).
