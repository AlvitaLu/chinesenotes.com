      <p>
        Complex sentences are made up of two or more simple sentences.
        The simple sentences that complex sentences are composed from are called clauses.
        In between the clauses a comma or a semicolon is used to represent a pause in spoken language.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>你点一个荤的，我点一个素的。 You order a meat dish, I will order a vegetarian dish.
          <p>
            (The two clauses have a logical connection.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>他篮球打的好，（他）足球也踢的好。 He plays basketball well and [he] also plays soccer well.
          <p>
            (If the clauses have the same subject then it is only necessary to write it once.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>因为现在是高峰，所以路上的车很多。 Since it is peak hour, so there are a lot of cars on the road.
          <p>
            (This complex sentence uses the correlatives 因为…所以 to express the relationship between the clauses.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Correlatives (关联词) are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Conjunctions that connect clauses
          <p>
            不但撞车的人酒后驾车，而且他逃逸现场。 Not only was the driver of the car that collided driving under the influence but he also fled the scene.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Adverbs with a connecting function
          <p>
            他又会数学，又会弹钢琴。 He can do math and he can also play the piano.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Complex sentences can be divided into the two types coordinate complex sentence and subordindate complex sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contracted sentences express the content of a complex sentence with the syntax of a simple sentence.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>我头疼不去。 I have a headache, I am not going.
          <p>
            (This means that because 我头疼 'I have a headache' so 不去 'I am not going'.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>我想说就说。 If I feel like saying something then I will.
          <p>
            (The conjunction 如果 is omitted.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class='article'><a name='coordinate'></a>并列复句 Coordinate Complex Sentences</h3>
      <p>
        A coordinate complex sentence is composed of clauses with coordinate relations.
        In a coordinate complex sentence all the clauses are equal, there are no primary-secondary relations. 
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>不是我不想帮助，而是我不会。 It is not that I don't want to help, it is that I don't know how.
          <p>
            (This is a coordinative relation where the clauses each explain two different matters.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>孩子下课以后，我到学校接他。 When the child finishes class, I will go to school to pick him up.
          <p>
            (Successive relation, there is a sequence in the arrangement of the clauses.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>这个下猴子不但聪明，而且能干。 This young man is not only clever but is very capable.
          <p>
            (Progressive relation, the second clause progresses a step beyond the first clause.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>你想吃米饭，还是想吃面？ Would you like to eat rice or eat noodles?
          <p>
            (Alternative relation, the two conditions cannot coexist.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Attention needs to be given to the position of correlatives in coordinate complex sentences:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>不管我们是朋友，但是我还得给你提醒这件事。 Even though we are friends, I have to remind you about this matter.
          <p>
            (If the subjects of the clauses are different then conjunctions should be placed before the subjects.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>咱们俩不但是同事，而且是朋友。 Not only are the two of us coworkers but we are also friends.
          <p>
            (If the clauses have the same subject then the conjunctions should be placed after the subject.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>咱们先吃饭，我以后才出去买东西。 Let's eat first, afterwards I will go out to buy some things.
          <p>
            (Adverbs are always placed after the subject.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Commonly encountered correlatives in coordinate complex sentences include 不是、还是，还、然后、而、而且、或、或者、就、又、也、不但、一边、一面、and 一方面.
      </p>

      <p>
        A subordindate complex sentence is composed of clauses with a subordinate relation.  
        Between the clauses there is a primary and a secondary.
        For example,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>尽管我早晨六点到了售票处，但是我还没买到票。 Even though I arrived at the ticket office at 6 am, I was still not able to buy a ticket.
          <p>
            (Contrasting relation &mdash; the first clause is the subordinate clause and and the second clause is the main clause.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>因为我的电视机坏了，所以没办法看冬奥会。 Because my television was broken, there was no way for me to watch the Winter Olympics.
          <p>
            (Causative relation &mdash; the first clause [the subordinate clause] explains the reason and the second clause
            [the main clause] explains the result.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>如果不小心，意外会发生的。 (If you are not careful, an accident may happen.
          <p>
            (Supposition or conditional relation &mdash; the first clause explains the condition and the second clause explains the result if the condition is satisfied.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Often encountered correlative conjunctions in subordindate complex sentences include: 宁可、与其、就是、即使、假如、如果、要是、除非、只有、无论、不论、不管、既然、由于、因为、尽管、虽然、但是、为的是、因此、and 所以. Frequently encountered correlative adverbs in the main clauses of subordindate complex sentences include: 才、就、也、都、即、反而.
