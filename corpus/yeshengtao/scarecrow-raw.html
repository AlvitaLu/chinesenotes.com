<h3>稻草人／叶圣陶著（部分）</h3>
<p>A Scarecrow by Ye Shengtao (Fragments)</p>

<p>稻草人是农人亲手造的。他的骨架子是竹园里的细竹枝；他的肌肉，皮肤是隔年的黄稻草。<br/>
A scarecrow is made by farmers. His skeleton is made up further of the thin
bamboo branches in from bamboo gardens. His muscles and skin are made from the
yellow rice straws from last year. (p. 2)</p>

<p>他不吃饭，也不睡觉<br/>
He does not eat and he also does not sleep. (p. 4)</p>

<p>他都知道得清清楚楚<br/>
he knows everything very clearly (p. 6)</p>
