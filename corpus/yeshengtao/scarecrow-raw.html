<h3>稻草人／叶圣陶著（部分）</h3>
<p>A Scarecrow by Ye Shengtao (Fragments)</p>

<p>稻草人是农人亲手造的。他的骨架子是竹园里的细竹枝；他的肌肉，皮肤是隔年的黄稻草。<br/>
A scarecrow is made by farmers. His skeleton is made up further of the thin
bamboo branches in from bamboo gardens. His muscles and skin are made from the
yellow rice straws from last year. (p. 2)</p>

<p>他不吃饭，也不睡觉<br/>
He does not eat and he also does not sleep. (p. 4)</p>

<p>他都知道得清清楚楚<br/>
he knows everything very clearly (p. 6)</p>

<p>她的眼泪流得更多了，眼睛受了伤，看东西模糊，稍微远一点儿就看不见。<br/>
She cried even more and her eyes became impaired. She could not see things
clearly. If things were too far away, [she] could not see them. (p. 10)</p>

<p>再看看那稻草人...位置没有动，样子也跟以前一摸一样，她看一切事情都很好<br/>
Looking at the scarecrow, its position had not moved, shape was still the same
as before. She saw that everything was very good. (p. 18)</p>
