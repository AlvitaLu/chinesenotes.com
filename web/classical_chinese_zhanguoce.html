        Long ago the Zeng Zi lived in the city of Bi.
        [A city in the state of Lu, under the juristiction of the East China Sea.]
        There was a man from Bi with the same name and clan [name, clan, and surname] as Zeng Zi who killed someone.
        Someone told Zeng's mother “Zeng Shen has killed someone.”
        Zeng Zi's mother said, “My son would not kill anyone.”
        She continued to weave calmly.
        [Seemingly, as if it was in the past.]
        Shortly afterwards someone else said, “Zeng Shen has killed someone.”
        His mother still continued to calmly weave.
        Shortly afterwards another man told her, “Zeng Shen has killed  someone.”
        His mother became afraid, threw away her shuttle, climbed over the wall and left.
        [Climbed over the wall and fled.]
        In spite of Zeng Shen's virtue and his mother's and his mother's faith in him when three 
        men accuse him his mother, despite her love, his mother was unable to have faith.
