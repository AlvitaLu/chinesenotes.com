        Records of the Historian
      </h2>
      <p>
        史记 Records of the Historian (sometimes translated as Records of the Grand Historian) was written by 司马迁 Sima Qian in the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian was considered the father of Chinese history for his compilation of this work, the first systematic Chinese historical text. The work was actually started by Sima Qian's father 司马谈 Sima Tan.
      <p>
      <p>
        Records of the Historian is divided into 12 volumes of 本纪 Imperial Biographies, 10 volumes of 表 Tables containing timelines of events, 8 volumes of 书 Treatises, 30 volumes of 世家 Biographies of the Feudal Houses and Eminent Persons, and 70 volumes of 列傳 Biographies and Collective Biographies.
      </p>

        Shi She
      </h3>
      <p class='example'>
        石奢者，楚昭王相也。坚直廉正，无所阿避。行县，道有杀人者，相追之，乃其父也。纵其父而还，自系焉使人言之王曰，杀人者臣之父也。夫以父立政，不孝也。废法纵罪，非忠也。臣罪当死。王曰追而不及，不当伏罪。子其治事矣。石奢曰不私其父，非孝子也，不奉主法，非忠臣也。王赦其罪上惠也，伏誅而死，臣职也。遂不受令，自刎而死。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Shi She was a minister to King Zhao of Chu.
        He was upright, honest, impartial, and did not flatter or avoid his duty. 
        He was inspecting his county and assisted in pursuit of a murderer, which turned out to 
        be his own father.
        He severed ties with his father.
        This caused him to say to the king, “The murderer is the father of an official.
        Now, according to established tradition I have have not been filial.
        Breaking the law and with this crime also shows disloyalty.
        The minister should die for this crime.”
        The king said, “Your pursuit shows otherwise.  It would not be suitable to punish you.
        Please take care of the matter.”
        Shi She said, “He is not my own father.  I am an unfilial son. I do not accept my host's 
        course of action. The minister has been disloyal.”
        The kings pardon of my guilt is beyond a blessing.  I should be executed.”
        Thereupon, without receiving any order, he cut his own throat.

       Yan Zi's Charioteer
      </h3>
      <p class='example'>
        晏子为齐相。出，其御之妻，从门閒而窥其夫。其夫为相御，拥大盖，策驷马，意气扬扬什自得也。既而归，其妻请去。夫问其故。妻曰，晏子长不满六尺，身相齐国名显诸侯。今者妾观其出，志念深矣，常有以自下者。今子长八尺，乃为人仆御，然子之意自自以为足。妾是以求也。其后夫自损抑。晏子怪而问之，御以实对，晏子荐以为大夫。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Yan Zi was a minister for the state of Qi.
        On his way out the wife of his charioteer peeked at her husband through the gap in the door.
        This man acted as the charioteer for the minister, supported a large parasol, whipped a team of four horses, 
        and was very satisfied with himself.
        On finishing and returning, his wife asked to go.
        The man asked her for what reason?
        His wife said, “Elder Yan Zi is nearly six feet tall, is a high minister for the 
        state of Qi, and has the title of a feudal lord.
        This morning the concubine saw him leave with noble thoughts and a humble manner.
        Now Sir has grown to eight feet tall, behaving so graciously to his servant charioteer, as if he 
        were the minister.
        The concubine pleads to go.”
        After this the man became dispirited.
        Yan Zi considered this strange and asked him, “Charioteer, what would you do if Yan Zi 
        recommended you for minister?”

        Han Gao Zu
      </h3>
      <p class='example'>
        高祖以亭长为县送徒郦山，多道亡，自度比至皆亡之。到丰西泽中，止饮。夜乃解纵所送徒曰，公等皆去吾亦从此逝矣。徒中壮士愿从者十余人。高祖被酒，夜径泽中，令一人行前，行前者还报曰，前有大蛇当径，愿还。高祖醉曰，壮士，何畏，乃前。拔剑击斩蛇，蛇遂分为两，径开。行数里，醉因卧。后人来至蛇所，有一老妪夜哭。人问何哭，妪曰，人杀吾子故哭之。人曰妪子何为见杀。妪曰吾子白帝子也，化为蛇，当道，今为赤帝子斩之，故哭。人乃以妪为不诚，欲笞之，妪因忽不见。后人至，高祖觉，后人告高祖，高祖乃心独喜自负。诸从者日益畏之。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Han Gao Zu was a Ting leader to lead people on foot to Mount Li from his county. 
        Many of the people being led escaped on the way.  From his own estimate by the time they 
        reached their destination most of the people escaped.
        Arriving at the city of Feng on the western marshes they stopped for a drink.
        At night he unbound the people travelling on foot and said, “You are all free to 
        go. In fact, I am going to leave as well.”
        Amongst the people travelling on foot were several stout men that were willing to follow 
        and ten men remained behind.
        One night Han Gao Zu was drunk travelling through the marshes with a person leading the 
        way in front.  The person leading the way came back and reported, “There is a large snake 
        in front blocking the way. I want to go back.”
        Gao Zu drunkenly said, “A strong man like you should not be scared.  Continue ahead!”
        He took out his sword and chopped the snake in two opening the path.
        After walking a few li he was so drunk that he laid down.
        When the people following behind arrived at the place the snake was they saw an old woman 
        crying in the night.
        The person asked the old lady why she was crying.  The old lady said, “Someone killed my 
        son.  I am crying for my son.”
        The person asked， “Old lady, how was your son killed?”
        The old lady said, “My son is the son of the White Heavenly Emperor. He transformed into a 
        snake to block the path but today the son of the Red Heavenly Emperor beheaded him, which is why 
        I am crying.”
        Thus the man thought that the old lady was lying and wanted to whip her when suddenly the 
        old lady disappeared.
        When the person following arrived Gao Zu woke up.  The person told Gao Zu the story.  
        Gao Zu alone felt happy and self-confident.
        All those following him became more fearful of him each day.
      </p>

        汉高祖 Han Gao Zu is the posthumous name for 刘邦 Liu Bang (c. 256—195 BCE), a bandit leader who became first Han emperor. He reigned from 202—195 BCE. A 亭 Ting was an Qin administrative unit of ten villages. 郦山 Mount Li is located east of Chang'an. This text is from the section 本纪 Imperial Biographies.

        Chunyu Kun
      </h3>
      <p class='example'>
        孔子曰，六艺于治一也。礼以节人，乐以发和，书以道事，诗以达意，易以神化，春秋以义。太史公曰，天道恢恢，岂不大哉。谈言微中，亦可以解纷。淳于髡者，齐之赘婿也，长不满七尺，滑稽多辩，数使诸侯，未尝屈辱。齐威王之时，喜隐，好为淫乐长夜之饮，沈湎不治，委政卿大夫。百官荒乱，诸侯并侵，国且危亡，在于旦暮，左右莫敢谏。淳于髡说之以隐曰，国中有大鸟，止王之庭，三年不蜚又不鸣，王不知此鸟何也。王曰，此鸟不飞则已，一飞冲天，不鸣则已，一鸣惊人。于是乃朝诸县令长七十二人，赏一人，诛一人，奋兵而出。诸侯振惊，皆还齐侵地，威行三十六年。语在田完世家中。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Confucius said, “The six arts should be treated as one.
        Ritual restrains people, music sends out harmony, writing speaks of things, 
        poetry conveys intentions, the cannon of change beings divine change.  
        The Spring and Autumn Annals uses righteousness.”
        The Grand Scribe says, the path to heaven is very, very long.
        Subtle discussion is most appropriate and also resolves confusion.
        Chunyu Kun was from the state of Qi and adopted into his wife's family. He was just under 
        seven [Chinese] feet tall. He was satirical and argumentative, being humiliated by the 
        feudal lords on more than one occasion.
        King Wei of Qi liked riddles.  After long nights of drinking for wanton 
        pleasure, he was in a drunked stupor which he could not revive from and so delegated rule 
        to his senior officials.
        From dawn to dusk the government was in chaos, feudal lords from surrounding regions 
        invaded, the state was headed for collapse, and retainers and officials did not dare 
        complain.
        Chunyu Kun persuaded the king to listen to a riddle: “In the capital there is a large 
        bird that has stopped in the king's courtyard for three years without flying or chirping. 
        What is it?”
        The king said, “This bird does not fly but if it did it would rush into the sky.  
        It does not chirp but if it did it would startle people.”
        Thereupon he brought 72 people to court, including various leaders and chiefs. He showed 
        appreciation for some, executed others, and gave direction to raise an army for an 
        expedition.
        The feudal lords were alarmed and frightened.  All of them returned the land they had taken 
        from Qi before.  King Wei ruled for thirty six years. 
        This is discussed in the section Tian Wan in the Biographies of the Feudal Houses and 
        Eminent Persons section.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        威王八年，楚大发兵加齐。齐王使淳于髡之赵，请救兵，齎金百斤，车马十驷。淳于髡仰天大笑，冠缨索绝。王曰，先生少之乎。髡曰，何敢。王曰，笑岂有说乎。髡曰，今者臣从东方来，见道傍有禳田者，操一豚蹄，酒一盂，祝曰，瓯楼满篝，汙邪满车，五谷蕃熟，穰穰满家。臣见其所持者狭，而所欲者奢，故笑之。于是齐威王乃益齎黄金千镒，白璧十双，车马百驷。髡辞而行至赵。赵王与之精兵十万，革车千乘。楚闻之，夜引兵而去。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        In the eighth year of the rule of King Wei the state of Chu sent out a large number of 
        troops to annex the state of Qi.
        The King of Qi used Chunyu Kun of Zhao to request that the state of Zhao rescue Qi's 
        troops.  Chunyu Kun presented the state of Zhao with 50 jin of gold and chariots and 
        horses for ten teams of four horses each.
        Chunyu Kun looked up at the sky and laughed uproariously. The string connecting the tassel 
        to his hat broke.
        The king said, “Sir, is that too few?”
        Chun said, “I would not dare.”
        The king said, “How could it be that you are laughing as you speak?”
        Chun said, “I was travelling to the east today and saw an offering on the roadside. 
        It held a pig's trotter, a bowl of wine, and prayed ‘Shall the high ground be enough to 
        fill a basket, shall the low ground be enough to fill a cart, shall the five grains 
        flourish and ripen, shall they be abundant enough to satisfy our family.’
        Your servant saw the narrow nature of this grasping and desire for extravagance and it 
        caused me to laugh.”
        Consequently, King Wei of Qi thus increased the gift to one thousand yi of gold, ten pairs 
        of white jade ceremonial disks, and a hundred chariots and teams of four horses each. 
        Kun took his leave and travelled to the state of Zhao.
        The king of Zhao gave him one hundred thousand crack troops and one thousand leather 
        covered chariots.
        The state of Chu heard about this and at night withdrew their troops.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        威王大说，置酒后宫，召髡赐之酒。问曰，先生能饮几何而醉。对曰，臣饮一斗亦醉，一石亦醉。威王曰，先生饮一斗而醉，恶能饮一石哉。其说可得闻乎。髡曰，赐酒大王之前，执法在傍御史在后，髡恐惧俯伏而饮，不过一斗径醉矣。若亲严客，髡帣韝鞠跽，待酒于前，时赐余沥，奉觞上寿，数起，饮不过二斗径醉。若朋友交游，久不相见，卒然相睹，欢然道故，私情相语，饮可五六斗径醉矣。若乃州闾之会，男女杂坐，行酒稽留，六博投壶，相引为曹，握手无罚，目眙不禁，前有堕珥，后有遗簪，髡窃乐此，饮可八斗而醉二参。日暮酒阑，合尊促坐，男女同席，履舄交错，杯盘狼藉，堂上烛灭，主人留髡而送客，罗襦襟解，微闻薌泽，当此之时，髡心最欢，能饮一石。故曰，酒极则乱，乐极则悲，万事尽然，言不可极，极之而衰。以讽谏焉。齐王曰，善，乃罢长夜之饮。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        King Wei was very delighted and put on a party in the rear of the palace and invited Kun.
        He asked, “How many drinks does it take you to get drunk?”
        Kun replied, “It might take one peck [two liters] for your servant to become drunk. 
        With twenty pecks I would also be drunk.”
        King Wei said, “Sir, if you get drunk on one peck, how could you possibly drink ten?
        Please explain how that is possible?”
        Kun said, “Great king you invite me to drink with you but behind me is the censor who 
        upholds the law. I am scared of falling over drunk because one peck might do it right 
        away.
        If my parents had an important visitor, I would roll up my sleeves and kneel humbly, 
        wait for there be only a few drops of the wine in front of me left, and only then take 
        the goblet and toast the long life of the guest. So it would have only taken me two pecks 
        to get drunk.
        If I had not seen a friend or companion for a long time and we suddenly met.  
        We would happily talk about old times and personal feelings and it would I would 
        drink five or six pecks and then be drunk.
        If three was a gathering of people from my village with a mix of men and women drinking 
        wine and lingering around playing liu bo or pitch pot.  If I found that I and a companion 
        were mutually attracted to each other, holding hands without fear and not able to stop 
        staring at each other. Maybe an earing or a hairpin would be dropped. Although I should 
        not I would enjoy this and be able to drink eight pecks of wine and only be about two 
        thirds drunk.
        At sunset when the wine is finished, with the wine from the bottles combined together, 
        a man and a woman are sitting at the same seat after a lively party with cups and dishes 
        in disorder, the candles in the hall out, the master leaving me to send off guests, 
        my under-shirt unbuttoned, smelling a delicate fragrance.  At that time I would be the 
        most happy and able to drink ten pecks.
        This leads me to say that drinking too much causes chaos, to many parties causes 
        unhappiness, ten thousand of anything can be not enough, discussion can also be too much, 
        and too much of anything looses its value.”
        Thus criticizing through indirection.
        The king of Qi said, “Very good.  So we will stop our long nights of drinking.”

        A 令 Ling commands a region of 10 000 people or more and a 长 Zhang is the chief of a smaller area. In the Warring States period one jin was 256 grams (not 500 grams as it is today). An 镒 is a measure of weight equal to 20 taels (liang) or two jin in the modern Chinese market system. A 斗 peck at that time and place was 1.94 liters. These measures were all before the standardization under Qin Shi Huang and are not equal to the equivalents in the more recent Chinese market system.

        In the 周 Zhou system a 闾 Zhou had 25 households and a 州 had 2,500 households.
