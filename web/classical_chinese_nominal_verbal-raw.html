      <h3 class='article'>Nouns and Nominal Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        In a topic-comment sentence there are two types of comments: nominal and verbal.
        A nominal sentence has a nominal (noun-like) phrase as its comment. 
        Usually this means that a nominal phrase forms the predicate of the sentence.
        In contrast, a verbal sentence has a verbal (verb-like) phrase as its comment.
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="nominal"></a>Nominal Phrases</h4>
      <p>
        A nominal sentence has the form A B 也, which is a statement that A is a type of B. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        生而知之者，上也<br/>
        Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men.
      </p>
      <p>
        from 论语 The Analects of Confucius (see below). The topic of this sentence is 生而知之者.
      </p>
      <p>
        In nominal sentences in classical Chinese, depending on the period and author, there is often no copula, like 'is' in Enlgish or 是 in modern Chinese. The copula is nearly entirely missing in early classical Chinese texts and more commonly encountered in later texts. In later texts 也 as a final particle also becomes less common.
      </p>
      <p>
        The negative form for this type of sentence is usually A 非 B 也. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        非敢后也<br/>
        I did not have the courage to lag behind
      </p>
      <p>
        also from the Analects (see below).  The unstated but implied subject in this example is I.
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="text"></a>Text Analects 16.9</h4>
      <p class='example'>
        孔子曰：「<br/>
        生而知之者，上也；<br/>
        学而知之者，次也；<br/>
        困而学之，又其次也。<br/>
        困而不学，民斯为下矣！<br/>
        」
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Confucius said, <br/>
        'Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. <br/>
        Those who learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the next.<br/>
        Those who are have difficulty and yet overcome that in learning, are another class next to these. <br/>
        As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn are the lowest of the people.'<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Analects are the sayings of Confucius recorded by his disciples (c. 479 BCE—221 BCE)
        and is a model of an early classical Chinese writing.
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="text2"></a>Text Analects 6.13</h4>
      <p class='example'>
        子曰、<br/>
        孟之反不伐、<br/>
        奔而殿、将入门、策其马、<br/>
        曰、非敢后也、马不进也。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        The Master said, <br/>
        'Meng Zhifan does not boast of his merit. <br/>
        Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when they were about to enter the gate, 
        he whipped up his horse, <br/>
        saying, "It is not that I dare to be last. My horse would not advance."'<br/>
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="questions"></a>Questions</h4>
      <p>
        In very early classical texts, such as 左传 Zuozhuan the interrogative particle 乎 was added after 也 to form questions. Later, the combination 乎也 was replaced by 与 or 邪. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        夫非尽人之子与<br/>
        Are we not all somebody's son?
      </p>
      <p>
        from 孟子 Mencius and
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        其正色邪<br/>
        Is this its true color?
      </p>
      <p>
        from 庄子 Zhuang Zi.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final particle 夫 means is it not? and is used in a similar way to the modern particle 吧. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        然而至此极者，命也夫<br/>
        Thus I have arrived at this eventuality.  Is it not fate?
      </p>
      <p>
        from 庄子 Zhuang Zi.
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="pronouns"></a>Pronouns and Particles
      </h4>
      <p>
        A pronoun can be substituted for a noun when using a nominal predicate. Commonly encountered pronouns are 此, 斯, and 是. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        此文王之勇也<br/>
        This was King Wen's bravery.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        是亦走也<br/>
        This is also running away.
      </p>
      <p>
        both from Mencius. In high classical Chinese 是 was a pronoun rather than a verb as it is in modern Chinese. It aquired this function in the Han Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pronoun 皆 is used when the subject is plural. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        五蕴皆空<br/>
        all five skandhas are empty
      </p>
      <p>
        from the Heart Sutra.
