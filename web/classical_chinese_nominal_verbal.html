      <h3 class='article'>Nouns and Nominal Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        In a topic-comment sentence there are two types of comments: nominal and verbal.
        A nominal sentence has a nominal (noun-like) phrase as its comment. 
        Usually this means that a nominal phrase forms the predicate of the sentence.
        In contrast, a verbal sentence has a verbal (verb-like) phrase as its comment.
      </p>
      <h4 class='article'><a id="nominal"></a>Nominal Phrases</h4>
      <p>
        A nominal sentence has the form A B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span>, which is a statement that A is a type of B. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='生' data-wordid='3220,6914,10999,11494,11495,28915,30568,30569,30570,30571,30572,30573,30574,30575,30576,30577,30578,30579,30580,30581,30582,30583,30584' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>生</span><span title='而' data-wordid='1336,6960,37610,37611,37612,37613,37614,37615,37616,37617,37618,37619,37620' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>而</span><span title='知' data-wordid='3896,31761,31762,31763,31764,31766,31767,31769,31770,31771,31772,31774' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>知</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span>，<span title='上' data-wordid='584,585,586,33542,33668,33669,33670,33671,33672,33673,33674,33675,33676,33677,33678,33681,33682,33683,33684,33685,33686,34965' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>上</span><span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span><br/>
        Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men.

      <p>
        from The Analects of Confucius <span title='论语' data-wordid='7228' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>论语</span> (see below). The topic of this sentence is <span title='生' data-wordid='3220,6914,10999,11494,11495,28915,30568,30569,30570,30571,30572,30573,30574,30575,30576,30577,30578,30579,30580,30581,30582,30583,30584' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>生</span><span title='而' data-wordid='1336,6960,37610,37611,37612,37613,37614,37615,37616,37617,37618,37619,37620' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>而</span><span title='知' data-wordid='3896,31761,31762,31763,31764,31766,31767,31769,31770,31771,31772,31774' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>知</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In nominal sentences in classical Chinese, depending on the period and author, there is often no copula, like 'is' in Enlgish or <span title='是' data-wordid='277,13237,13238,17908,20862,20863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>是</span> in modern Chinese. The copula is nearly entirely missing in early classical Chinese texts and more commonly encountered in later texts. In later texts <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span> as a final particle also becomes less common.
      </p>
      <p>
        The negative form for this type of sentence is usually A <span title='非' data-wordid='1003,7045,12024,12025,33285,33286,33289,33291,33293,33294,33296,33297,33298,33299,33300,33301' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>非</span> B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span>. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='非' data-wordid='1003,7045,12024,12025,33285,33286,33289,33291,33293,33294,33296,33297,33298,33299,33300,33301' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>非</span><span title='敢' data-wordid='1659,17195' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>敢</span><span title='后' data-wordid='1149,1150,33219,33220,33221,33222,33223,33224,33225,33226,33473' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>后</span><span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span><br/>

        Confucius said, <br/>
        'Those who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. <br/>
        Those who learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the next.<br/>
        Those who are have difficulty and yet overcome that in learning, are another class next to these. <br/>
        As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn are the lowest of the people.'<br/>

        A pronoun can be substituted for a noun when using a nominal predicate. Commonly encountered pronouns are <span title='此' data-wordid='624,37921,37922' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>此</span>, <span title='斯' data-wordid='3458,30552,30554,30556,30557' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>斯</span>, and <span title='是' data-wordid='277,13237,13238,17908,20862,20863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>是</span>. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='此' data-wordid='624,37921,37922' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>此</span><span title='文王' data-wordid='39511' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文王</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='勇' data-wordid='732,17909' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>勇</span><span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span><br/>
        This was King Wen's bravery.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='是' data-wordid='277,13237,13238,17908,20862,20863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>是</span><span title='亦' data-wordid='5060,31075' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>亦</span><span title='走' data-wordid='1343,7018' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>走</span><span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span><br/>
        This is also running away.

        both from Mencius. In high classical Chinese <span title='是' data-wordid='277,13237,13238,17908,20862,20863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>是</span> was a pronoun rather than a verb as it is in modern Chinese. It aquired this function in the Han Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pronoun <span title='皆' data-wordid='5046,33183' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>皆</span> is used when the subject is plural. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='五蕴' data-wordid='5049' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>五蕴</span><span title='皆' data-wordid='5046,33183' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>皆</span><span title='空' data-wordid='3876,3881,3882,17657,30628,30629,30630,30631' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>空</span><br/>
