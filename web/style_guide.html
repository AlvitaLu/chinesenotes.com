      <h2>Dictionary Style Guide</h2>
<p>
  This page describes the things to consider when writing a dictionary entry.
  To add a word use the form at 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AcPDJ3CSIyn7MNVDKiMHby4EMPH0g3FxwLRTlJKhxmA/viewform?usp=send_form"
  >Add or Change Word</a>.
  The design of the dictionary is described in the page 
  <a href='dictionary_design.html'>Dictionary Design</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Except for the CEDICT project, wich has a Creative Commons Attribution
  license, or the Unihan, which has a licence that allows copying, never copy
  text directly. For sources subject to copyright compare
  several sources and compare against the text in CEDICT, Wikipedia, Baidu
  Baike, and examples from the corpus. Use the most reasonable subject and / or
  reword the text. 
  It is not necessary to reference the CEDICT project for specific entries
  because the dictionary in chinesenotes.com is based on CEDICT.
  If published sources are used then they should be referenced in
  Harvard short style or with an abbreviations from the
  <a href='help.html'>Help</a> page.
</p>
<h3>Dictionary Entry Components</h3>
<h4>Headwords</h4>
<p>
  Headwords can be words or multi-word expressions. Multi-word expressions
  should be included if they are used as a unit, for example a company name,
  or a common expressions, for example <a title='hóngsè yùjǐng | red alert' href='/words/41356.html'>红色预警</a> 'red alert.'
  A headword is created by adding one or more entries to the words.txt file.
  The chinesenotes software will group together multiple lexical units with the
  same simplified and traditional Chinese text into the same headword.
  If the term is very specific to a single organization then it should be added
  in a file or its own. An example of this is the 
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/buddhist-dictionary/blob/master/data/dictionary/fgs_mwe.txt"
  >fgs_mwe.txt</a> used for Fo Guang Shan specific terms.
</p>
<h4>Word id</h4>
<p>
  Each lexical unit has a unique word id. These are assigned in numeric
  sequence. There will generally be multiple lexical units for each headword.
  Each lexical unit will differ in word sense, grammar, or pronunciation.
</p>
<h4>Simplified Chinese</h4>
<p>
  The Simplified Chinese field is compulsory. If the simplified Chinese text
  is the same as the traditional Chinese then add it here and leave the
  traditional Chinese field blank. For single character word entries check
  the Unihan Database.
</p>
<h4>Traditional Chinese</h4>
<p>
  The Traditional Chinese field is only added if the traditional Chinese
  text is different from the simplified Chinese.
  The Unihan Database (“Unicode Han Database,” 2015) should be consulted for
  mappings between simplified and traditional Chinese characters.
</p>
<h4>Pinyin</h4>
<p>
  The Pinyin field is mandatory. Add the pinyin text with the proper 
  diacritics to indicate tone. For example, <a title='fènglí | pineapple' href='/words/41222.html'>凤梨</a> fènglí. Use the 
  <a href="pinyin_format.php">Format Pinyin tool</a> to add the diacritics.
</p>
<h4>Grammar</h4>
<p>
  The Grammar field is mandatory. Use one of the values in 
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/data/grammar.txt"
  >grammar.txt</a>.
</p>
<h4>English</h4>
<p>
  The English field is mandatory. It should contain direct translations
  or near synonyms in English delimited by '/.' Commas, periods, and other 
  punctuation other than double quotes can be include. Do not use plain ASCII
  double quotes ". If you have to use double quotes, use a Unicode stylized
  double quote like “”. Several English equivalents of the Chinese source word
  should be provided because one English equivalent will rarely be adequate
  in all situations. 
</p>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
  Concept is an optional field. It indicates what kind of thing a word
  refers to. For example, for <a title='fènglí | pineapple' href='/words/41222.html'>凤梨</a> 'pineapple' the concept is (<a title='shuǐguǒ | fruit' href='/words/6006.html'>水果</a>, Fruit).
  If you enter a value for concept you must add simplified Chinese and
  English values. There is no fixed list of concepts.
</p>
<h4>Domain Labels</h4>
<p>
  Domain Label fields are mandatory. 
  Domain labels indicate specialized fields that words are used in, such as
  lingustics or medicine. In this dictionary domain labels are critical for
  separating modern Chinese, literary Chinese, and Buddhist vocabulary.
  Other values are helpful for dictionary users.
  For example, the entry for <a title='fènglí | pineapple' href='/words/41222.html'>凤梨</a> 'pineapple' the domain
  is (<a title='yǐn shí | food and drink' href='/words/4148.html'>饮食</a>, Food and Drink).
  The topic_cn and topic_en fields in Chinese and English respecitvely are used
  for this purpose.
  The values must be chosen from the list
  <a href="https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com/blob/master/data/topics.txt"
  >topics.txt</a>.
  The parent_cn and parent_en are subdomains, which are optional. 
  For example, History | China, 
  i.e. Chinese History as a subdomain of the domain History.
  There is no fixed list for subdomains. They can have any value but, if a value
  is provided, then both Simplified Chinese and English should be provided.
</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
  Try to provide some notes to allow users to find out more about a word.
  The notes section provides additional information about the word. 
  Examples should illustrate the word sense with English gloss of Chinese
  examples. English gloss is given in single quotes.
  The source of the example given in English or pinyin and Chinese.
  Examples should be taken from the corpera, so that they can be linked.
  Citations should be to an items listed in the 
  <a href="references.html">References</a> page.
  Explanations of collocations may be added as well, preferably with an example.
  Examples should not be invented. If an example from the corpus is too long
  or contains extraneous words, replace them with '...'
  Make sure that there are entries for any Chinese words used in the notes.
</p>
<p>
  Synonyms in Chinese may be provided to illustrate the word sense.
  Synonyms should exist in the dictionary. If the synonym does not exist then
  add it.
</p>
<p>
  Definitions or explanations of words may be provided, especially for concepts
  that do not have native English equivalents. This is important for historic
  and Buddhist words to avoid the need for the user to have to consult further
  references to understand a concept. Definitions of common concepts are
  difficult and may not be very useful. It may be more useful to the reader to
  cite a metaphor.
