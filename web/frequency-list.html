"393":{"element_text":"了","simplified":"了","traditional":"\N","pinyin":"le","english":"completion of an action","notes":"In this usage 了 is an aspectual particle 动态助词. Here 了 is placed after the verb and before its object to indicate that an action has been completed. (Li Shaoqi, 2003, pp. 430-431; Ho, 2002, '了' 1) For example, 他似乎明白了点 'he seemed to understand something.' (Lao She, 2003, p. 218) In this example the verb is 明白 'understand' and the object is 点 '[a little] something.' 了 cannot be used for non-action verbs, such as 喜欢, 是, 像. If there are two verbs in series then 了 should be placed after the second verb. 了 is the third most frequent word in the Beijing Language Institute's 1985 frequency wordlist. (Ho, 2002, '了')"},

"16959":{"element_text":"了","simplified":"了","traditional":"\N","pinyin":"le","english":"modal particle","notes":"In this use 了 appears at the end of a sentence as a modal particle 语气助词. Use as a modal particle differs from use as an aspectual particle after a verb in that a modal particle indicates the completion of the action for the whole sentence. Sometimes a modal particle is omitted if the sentence contains an aspectual particle and the action of the sentence is simple. (Ho, 2002, '了' 2) There are two common uses: 1. 了 may be used at the end of a sentence to indicate a newly emerged condition. For example, 一切的路都封上了 'All the roads were closed.' (Lao She, 2003, p. 175) 2. 了 may be used at the end of a sentence to indicate a reminder, advice, or urging."},
"41156":{"element_text":"了","simplified":"了","traditional":"\N","pinyin":"le","english":"particle used in certain fixed expressions","notes":"In this use 了 is used in a set of fixed expressions, including 太...了, ...极了, 对了, and 好了.

"277":{"element_text":"是","simplified":"是","traditional":"\N","pinyin":"shì","english":"is / are / am / to be","notes":"是 is used in this sense as a copular verb used between two nouns or noun phrases to indicate equality. (Ho, 2002, '是' 1; NCCED '是' 2) Use in this form is not common in Classical Chinese but was used as early as the Han. (Norman, 1988, p. 125) 是 is the fourth most frequently used word in the Beijing Language Institute's 1985 frequency wordlist. (Ho, 2002, '是')"},

(NCCED '是' 3) For example, 从此她是她，我是我，再也不吵嘴 'From now on, she will be who she is and I will be who I am but we will not quarrel again.' (Lao She, 2003, p. 205)"},
"502":{"element_text":"不","simplified":"不","traditional":"\N","pinyin":"bù","english":"not / no","notes":"不 is used for simple negation, as opposed to 没, which is used for existence. 不 is used before adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, except 有.

(Lao She, 2003, p. 207) This use is similar in both modern and literary Chinese. (Pulleyblank 1995, p. 103) For example, in literary Chinese, 不可，直不百步耳，是亦走也。'They should not do so. Though they did not run a hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' (Meng 1.3/1/26, translation by Legge) 不 is the sixth most frequently used word in the Beijing Language Institute's 1985 frequency wordlist. (Ho, 2002, '不')"},
