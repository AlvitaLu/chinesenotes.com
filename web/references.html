For example, 经研究发现 'after research, discovered ...' (Gu Sou Henan, 2015-10-15)  This example can be generalized to the pattern 经 (process) (state S) 'go through process P to arrive at state S.' In the example, the process is 研究 'research' and the state was that something was 发现 'discovered.' The subject is implied. The valency is three. 经 jīng also chains verbs together. Notice in the example that both arguments, 研究 'research' and 发现 'discover' are verbs.  经 jīng is the 97th most frequent word in the Beijing Language Institute's 1985 frequency wordlist. (Ho, 2002, '经') 经 jīng is also used in this sense in classical Chinese.
