      <h4 class='article'><a id="verbal"></a>Verbal Phrases</h4>
      <p>
        In verbal sentences the comment has a verb. Verbs may be transitive or
        intransitive. Transitive verbs take an object. For example, <span title='知' data-wordid='3896,31761,31762,31763,31764,31766,31767,31769,31770,31771,31772,31774' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>知</span><span title='其' data-wordid='1574,17492,30822,30823' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>其</span> (knew
        it). Intransitive do not take an object. For example, <span title='盗' data-wordid='4466,4467' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>盗</span><span title='亡' data-wordid='8525,17159,39492' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>亡</span> (the thief
        fled).
      </p>
      <p>
        An adjective describes a quality or continuing state of an object and
        are sometimes classified as stative verbs because they can form
        predicates. For example, <span title='山' data-wordid='3122,3718,6794' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>山</span><span title='高' data-wordid='953,7063,37567,37568,37569,37572,37573,37575,37576,37578,37579,37580,37581' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>高</span> (The mountain is tall). However,
        adjectives are more commonly found in front of nouns as modifiers.
        For example, <span title='富人' data-wordid='19302' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>富人</span> (a rich person). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Adjectives can also be made into transitive verbs by moving the subject
        to the object position.  For example
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='王' data-wordid='3235,3236,6909,17897,35027' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>王</span><span title='请' data-wordid='279,35970,38156,38157,38186' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>请</span><span title='大' data-wordid='1114,6778,17939,21124,38116,38117,38118,38119,38120,38121,38122,38273' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>大</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><br/>

        There was a rich person in the Song Kingdom whose wall broke after some rain.<br/>
        The person said,"I will not rebuild it.  There will inevitably be a thief."<br/>
        His neighbor's father also agreed.<br/>
        The sun set and, as a result, he lost a huge amount of his wealth.
        So that evening a thief plundered his home.<br/>
        Other families who knew him suspected his neighbor's father.

        This passage demonstrates a number of adjectives and verbs. In the first line the adjective <span title='富' data-wordid='1187' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>富</span> (rich) modifies the noun <span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (person). The very common transitive verb <span title='有' data-wordid='398,28914,32458' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>有</span> (to have) indicates that the state of Song has a rich man. The object of <span title='有' data-wordid='398,28914,32458' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>有</span> is <span title='富人' data-wordid='19302' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>富人</span> (the rich man). The intransitve verb <span title='亡' data-wordid='8525,17159,39492' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>亡</span> (to flee) is used in line 4. It was <span title='盗' data-wordid='4466,4467' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>盗</span> (the bandit) that fled.

      <h4 class='article'><a id="coordinate"></a>Coordinate Verbs</h4>
      <p>
        Coordinate verbs can be used to form a sequence of actions.  Verb coordination in classical
        Chinese usually implies that the first verb is an antecedent condition for the verb that
        follows. For example,
      </p>
      <p class='example'>

        A farmer plowing his field in the state of Song when a rabbit bumped
        into a tree stump and broke its neck and died.<br/>
        He was reluctant to use his plow, preferring to guard the tree stump
        and wait for the next rabbit.<br/>
        Of course, he did not catch a rabbit after that but did become the
        laughing stock of the state of Song.<br/>
        Today, we desire to rule like the former kings did in their age but we
        still have many people who are watching the tree stump waiting for a

      </h4>
      <p>
        In an active construction an agent of an action is in the subject
        position and followed by a 
        transitive verb and another noun in the object position.  For example, 
        from the passage above
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        <span title='宋' data-wordid='8739,8740' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>宋</span><span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span><span title='得' data-wordid='411,1459,1460,1461,9459,38236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>得</span><span title='兔' data-wordid='2616' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>兔</span><br/>
        The man from Song caught a rabbit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example <span title='宋' data-wordid='8739,8740' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>宋</span><span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (the man from Song) is the subject, <span title='得' data-wordid='411,1459,1460,1461,9459,38236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>得</span> (to obtain)
        is the verb, and <span title='兔' data-wordid='2616' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>兔</span> (rabbit) is the object. In a passive construction
        the object of the verb is placed before the verb. For example, from
        Mencius

        The host proceded and provisions were eaten.

      <p>
        Here the object <span title='粮' data-wordid='9615,37054' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>粮</span> (provisions) appears before the verb <span title='食' data-wordid='4355,7057,16032,17926,20177' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>食</span> (to eat). An
        active verb can be changed into a passive construction to change the

        in the state of Song laughed at him. The verb in this sentence is <span title='笑' data-wordid='831' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>笑</span>
        (to laugh). The object <span title='身' data-wordid='3898,7020,10994,17572,30076,30077,30078,30079,30080,30081,30082,30083,32350' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>身</span> (person) appears before the subject <span title='宋' data-wordid='8739,8740' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>宋</span><span title='国' data-wordid='1075,17752,33508,33509,33510,33511' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>国</span>

        Nominalization of a verb allows a writer to refer to the action of a
        verb as an object in itself. The most direct way to nominalize a verb
        is to make it the topic of a sentence. Another way is to make it the
        object of another verb. A third way is to use the nominalizing function
        word <span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span>. For example, in the phrase

        Negatives
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are a number of different terms for negation in classical Chinese:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span title='不' data-wordid='502,14076,14077' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>不</span> negates verbs. If a noun follows <span title='不' data-wordid='502,14076,14077' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>不</span> it is modified to act as a verb. For example, in Han Feizi's story from below

        <li>
          <span title='未' data-wordid='2187,2188' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>未</span> indicates that an action has not yet occurred, although it still may occur at some time in the future.

            This example demonstrates that the different types of negation can come in handy with
            double negatives.

        There was a man of the state of Chu who sold shields and spears. He bragged about his shields saying: “My shields are so hard that nothing can pierce through them.”<br/>
        He also bragged about his spears saying: “My spears are so sharp that there is nothing they cannot pierce through.”<br/>
        Someone said: “Sir, what would happen if people were to use your spears to pierce through your shields?’”<br/>
        The person could not respond.<br/>
        Obviously, shields that cannot be pierced by anything and spears that can pierce through anything cannot both exist at the same time.

        Pivot Verbs
      </h3>
      <p>
        A pivotal construction is one where a pivot joins two verbs by being the object of the first verb and the subject responsible for the action of the second verb. Certain verbs, including <span title='令' data-wordid='3958,17758,31963,31965,31966,31969,31970,31973,31974' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>令</span> (to lead to), <span title='使' data-wordid='832,30854,30855,30857,30858' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>使</span> (to cause), and <span title='劝' data-wordid='9462' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>劝</span> (to urge) are often found in these constructions.

        Yang Zhu's younger brother declared that he would go out wearing undyed white clothes.<br/>
        [Interpretation of the Classics says that clothes in “wear white clothes” is used for the sound.
        In the text below “wear black clothes” is the same.
        The text “White clothes” relies on this character.]<br/>
        A rain shower cuts through the plain white clothes.
        The clothes become black instead.<br/>
        The dog does not know any better but to greet him by barking.<br/>
        Yang Bu angrily beats the it the dog.<br/>
        Yang Zhu says to the master please do not beat the dog. 
        It appears that the master will listen.<br/>
        Turning to face him caused the dog to go away from him with white and towards him with black. How could you not blame it?
