      <h2>Dictionary Design</h2>
<p>
  This page describes the design of the dictionary. Readers interested in
  lexicography, contributing to the dictionary, or dictionary users wanting
  a deeper knowledge of the dictionary may find this page useful.
  See the <a href="style_guide.html">Style Guide</a> for details on writing 
  dictionary entries.
</p>
<p>
  The current Chinese Notes project is in its third life at present:
  <ol>
    <li>
  	  The initial project was a basic dictionary written in PHP beginning in
      about 2006. A collection of newpaper articles was informally collected.
      They was not organized formally as a corpus but just as a collection of
      web pages. PHP software was written to serve the web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
  	  Splitting off the NTI Reader project to ntireader.org to separate out
  	  Buddhist content. In the process the project was open-sourced, the
  	  Buddhist corpus was expanded, Python software was developed to process
  	  the corpus, and methodology was added for word sense disambiguation
  	  based on word sense frequency in the tagged part of the corpus.
    </li>
    <li>
  	  The Chinese Notes project is being open sourced, the site overhauled, 
  	  the corpus is being structured and expanded, Go software for processing
  	  the corpus is being added, and the writing of the dictionary entries is
  	  being formalized. This proces is just getting started.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3>Type and Purpose of the Dictionary</h3>
<p>
  The dictionary is a Chinese to English dictionary, including both literary
  Chinese and modern Chinese. The modern Chinese part could be considered
  a learners' dictionary with a focus on literary (aka classical) Chinese.
  The dictionary describes how words are used in the corpus of texts listed
  in the <a href='texts.html'>Texts</a> menu, the companion site
  <a href='ntireader.org'>NTI Reader</a> site, and other texts.
  The main purposes of the dictionary are 
  <ul>
    <li>
      To support the Chinese Notes text reader: In order to do this the 
      dictionary necessarily contains modern Chinese, literary Chinese,
      and special vocabularies. The primary purpose is to decode Chinese text
      but some help is provided to encode text. The user will do this
      by navigating from one of the words in the dictionary entry notes or the
      corpus through a mouse-over, 
      clicking on a Chinese word to bring up the popover, or searching on a 
      text string in the lookup tool on the main page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Look up individual Chinese words. The user will enter a single word
      in the lookup text field on the main page. Again, the primary purpose is
      decoding. That is, a user would look up a Chinese word to find the meaning
      explained in English. The 'English' field of the dictionary entries 
      provide the equivalent English terms to assist with decoding.
      Encoding could be either for Chinese or English text. That is, looking up
      a Chinese word in order to learn how to use it. The dictionary entry notes
      provide help for this for a limited number of words. Encoding could also
      be for assistance in optimally translating the term into English.
      The examples and explanation in the dictionary entry notes are also
      intended for this.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do miscelaeous searches: The user may not know the exact Chinese word
      but know something about it, such as a part of the word, one of the 
      English matching words, the pinyin text, or navigate to the word through
      a synonym or other kind of related word. In imporant feature to support
      this is word-to-meaning-to-word. For example, a user can look up a word,
      find synonyms to the word, and follow links to the details of the 
      synonyms. Also, a user may search on an English term and find definitions
      of Chinese words that include that English term. However, that does not
      make the dictionary bidirection because all the headwords are Chinese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Natural language text processing: A machine readable dictionary for
      doing automated text analysis for a number of purposes, including
      ngram analysis and discovery of new words in individual texts.
      Importantly, it is freely reusable by other people with the raw text files
      available on 
      <a href='https://github.com/alexamies/chinesenotes.com'>GitHub</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      A basis in literary Chinese for the NTI Buddhist Text Reader: Most
      Buddhist dictionaries only give the specialist terms. However, most of the
      words in the texts are non-specialist literary Chinese words, which takes
      considerable training to master.
    </li>
    <li>
      Word etymology - The user may want to know something about the word
      etymology, such as whether it was used in early texts.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>User Profiles and Assumed Skills</h3>
<p>
  Anybody can use the dictionary without restriction but there are certain
  features designed for particular users and certain skills required to make
  full use of it.
</p>
<p>
  Non-native speaking users in the process of learning Chinese will be able to
  make best use of the dictionary. Features of the dictionary, such as
  the lookup feature that breaks a text string into words will help these users.
  That will indentify the individual words as well as save time for repeated
  lookup. The notes explaining points on word function will also help these
  users.
</p>
<p>
  Users studying literary Chinese will benefit from the inclusion of many 
  literary Chinese word senses. The references to literary Chinese sources will
  help these users.
</p>
<p>
  Native speakers wanting to translate Chinese into English may benefit from
  the dictionary although it was not give very much guidance on optimal
  English word choice.
</p>
<p>
  The basic skills expected of users are:
  <ul>
    <li>
  	  Understanding of Hanyu pinyin
    </li>
    <li>
  	  Installation of fonts on their computer to display Chinese characters
    </li>
    <li>
  	  A basic understanding of Chinese grammar will be helpful to understand
  	  the parts of speech listed. In particular, there are a number differences
  	  with English grammar, such as Chinese measure words and particles.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Corpora</h3>
<p>
  Corpora and software for processing of corpora transformed lexicography
  beginning in the 1980's. (Atkins and Rundell, 2008, p. 53) This project has
  evolved from informal collection of words to more formal collection using
  corpora. The Chinese Notes project actually consists of four parts:
  <ul>
    <li>
  	  The dictionary data
    </li>
    <li>
  	  Several corpora of texts (under the Texts menu)
    </li>
    <li>
  	  Software for processing the corpora texts and generating HTML pages (a Go
  	  command line tool available in GitHub)
    </li>
    <li>
  	  Software for serving interactive web pages (PHP software in GitHub)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Previously, dictionary compilers created <strong>citations</strong>
  for words to demonstrate their use and ensure that the dictionary entries 
  were reliable. (Atkins and Rundell, 2008, pp. 53-54) This has been replaced by
  corpora and software for processing the corpora to identify the most common
  words and how they are used. The corpus in this project is an arbitrarily
  selected, as opposed to a carefully selected and balanced corpus, like the
  British National Corpus (BNC). (Atkins and Rundell, 2008, p. 53)
  The main criteria for selection of the text entries in Chinese Notes are
  feasibility, copyright, and personal interest.
  One difference between chinesenotes and other dictionaries is the open
  inclusion of the corpus and linking of dictionary entries with corpus data.
  The hope here is that the data will be useful for some users wanting to
  dig deeper into word meaning and use and that it will not be too confusing
  for other users who do not want to do that.
</p>
<h3>Dictionary Entries</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>headwords</strong> in the dictionary consist of Chinese words 
  written in simplified characters. If the simplified and traditional
  characters differ then the word written in traditional characters is
  provided as well. This enables the headwords to be written in either
  simplified or traditional form. The headwords include single character words,
  like <span title='个' data-wordid='281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>个</span> gè 'unit,' multi-character words, like <span title='表示' data-wordid='334' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>表示</span> biǎoshì 'to express,' and
  multiword expressions, like <span title='男扮女装' data-wordid='421' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>男扮女装</span> nán bàn nǘ zhuāng 'a man dressed as a
  woman.' Multiword expressions may be proper nouns, idioms, or other kinds of
  phrases. A multiword expression may be included as a headword if it the sum
  is more than the parts or it is a set phrase that must be written in a certain
  way. Set phrases are often literary Chinese embedded in modern Chinese, such
  as idioms from the Analects of Confucius 《<span title='論語' data-wordid='7228' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>論語</span>》.
  The headwords are stored in the file headwords.txt.
</p>
<p>
  Each entry in the lexical_units.txt file is a <strong>lexical unit</strong>. The 
  combination of fields that may vary with a given headword include, the
  word written in traditional text, Hanyu pinyin, part of speech, and
  English equiivalent. Other fields that provide additional information about
  a lexical unit include concept (in English and Chinese), topic (in English and
  Chinese), subtopic (in English and Chinese), image (a file name), mp3 (the
  name of a sound file), and notes. The notes field may contain explanatory
  notes, references, and examples.
  The file field in the lexical_units.txt file is the headword id.
</p>
<h3>Grammar</h3>
<p>
  This field is the part of speech of the Chinese word. It should match one
  of the entries in the grammar.txt file in GitHub. These parts of speech are
  intended for both modern Chinese and literary Chinese. However, it should be
  kept in mind that parts of speech are arguable for modern Chinese and
  especially flexible in literary Chinese.
</p>
<h3>English</h3>
<p>
  The English section of the lexical unit should include direct translations
  or near synonyms in English.
</p>
<h3>Domain Labels</h3>
<p>
  Domain labels indicate specialized fields that words are used in, such as
  lingustics or medicine. (Atkins and Rundell, 2008, p. 227)
  The topic_cn and topic_en fields are  in Chinese and English respecitvely.
  The parent_cn and parent_en are subdomains. For example, History | China, 
  i.e. Chinese History as a subdomain of the domain History.
</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
  The notes section provides additional information about the word. 
  For modern Chinese words notes explaining the use of the word should be given
  and examples included. Examples should illustrate the word sense with 
  English gloss of Chinese examples. English gloss is given in single quotes
  The source of the example given in English or pinyin and Chinese.
  For example, <span title='㣇' data-wordid='40426' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>㣇</span>：<span title='脩' data-wordid='29251,29251,29252,29252' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>脩</span><span title='豪' data-wordid='13860,27005,27006,27007,27008,27009,27010,27011,27012' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>豪</span><span title='獸' data-wordid='11339' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>獸</span>。 'Yì: a grand beast with long hair.' (Shuo Wen Jie Zi,
  Scroll 10 《<span title='說文解字' data-wordid='17080' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>說文解字</span>‧<span title='卷' data-wordid='7944,7945,7946,9988,12692,33039' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>卷</span><span title='十' data-wordid='310,6756,33465' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>十</span>》)
  Synonyms in the source language should be provided to illustrate the word
  sense.
</p>
<p>
  Collocators of headwords should be included to clarify word sense and
  indicate how to use the headword. Collocators of adjectives are usually
  nouns modified. (Atkins and Rundell, 2008, p. 217) For example, in the noun
  phrase <span title='大' data-wordid='1114,6778,17939,21124,38116,38117,38118,38119,38120,38121,38122,38273' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>大</span><span title='规模' data-wordid='2973' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>规模</span> 'large scale,' <span title='规模' data-wordid='2973' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>规模</span> guīmó is a collocator for for the headword 
  <span title='大' data-wordid='1114,6778,17939,21124,38116,38117,38118,38119,38120,38121,38122,38273' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>大</span> dà 'big' (adjective). Since space is not limited in electronic
  dictionaries, the full form is given instead of the traditional abbreviated
  form ~<span title='规模' data-wordid='2973' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>规模</span> '~ scale.' This also makes the gloss more easily readable.
  Collocators of nouns are the word that modify them. For example,
  <span title='蓝' data-wordid='473' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>蓝</span><span title='天' data-wordid='434,12586,13325,13326,13327,17756,40428' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>天</span> 'blue sky,' which also helps differentiate the sense headword, in this
  case sky versus heaven, which is another sense of <span title='天' data-wordid='434,12586,13325,13326,13327,17756,40428' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>天</span> tiān.
