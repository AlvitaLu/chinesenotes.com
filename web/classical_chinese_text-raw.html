        Duke Ping of Jin asks Shi Kuang (Garden of Stories)
      </h4>
      <p class='example'>
        晋平公问于师旷曰吾年七十，欲学恐已暮矣。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        师旷曰何不炳烛乎。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        平公曰安有为人臣而戏其君乎。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        臣闻之，<br/>
        少而好学，如日出之阳。<br/>
        壮而好学，如日中之光。<br/>
        老而好学，如炳烛之明
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        炳烛之明，熟与昧行乎。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        平公曰善哉
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Duke Ping of Jin said to Teacher Kuang, 'I am already seventy, I am afraid that my desire to study is already gone.'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Teacher Kuang said, 'Why not light up the candle?'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Duke Ping said, 'Why does the behavior of a servant mock his master?'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        The servant heard this:<br/>
        Study is good when young, like the sun at sunrise.<br/>
        Study is good in one's prime, like the light at noon.<br/>
        Study is good in one's old age, like the light from a candle.<br/>
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        How would you not choose lighting a candle instead of walking in the darkness?
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Duke Ping said, 'Very virtuous.'
      </p>
      <p>
        说苑 The Garden of Stories was written by 刘向 Liu Xiang (79—8 BCE). This style of story is a persuasion. A persuasion is a story where the ruler asks a question and the advisor replies with a surprising answer. The explanation of the surprising answer delivers a message. 师旷 was a well know musician from the time in Shanxi in present day 洪洞 Hongdong. This section is from 卷三 建本 Scroll 3 Building a Foundation.

        A Two Headed Snake (New Prefaces)
      </h4>
      <p class='example'>
        孙叔敖为婴儿之时，出游，见两头蛇，杀而埋之，归而泣。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        其母问其故。 叔敖对曰，闻见两头之蛇者死。 嚮者吾见之，恐去母而死也
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        其母曰，蛇今安在
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        曰，恐他人又见，杀而埋之矣。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        其母曰，吾闻有阴德者天报以福，汝不死也。 及长为楚令尹，未治而国人信其仁也。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        When Sun Shu ao was a young child he went out to play one time and saw a snake with two heads. 
        He killed and buried it then returned home and cried.
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        His mother asked him what the reason was.
        Shu ao faced her and said, 'I saw a dead snake with two heads.
        I saw it facing me and was scared of dying so ran to mother.'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        His mother asked, 'Where is the snake now?'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        He said, 'I was afraid of other people seeing it, so I killed and buried it.'
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        I sense a hidden good deed that heaven will repay with good luck.  You will not die.
        You will grow up to reach the level of chief minister of the State of Chu.  You will rule the people of the country with a belief in their humanity.

        Zhao Jianzi Asks Zi Gong (Garden of Stories)
      </h3>
      <p class='example'>
        赵简子问子贡曰，孔子为人何如。 子贡曰，鞅不能识也。 简子不说曰，子事孔子数十年终业而去之。 寡人问子，子曰不能识，何也。 子贡曰赐譬渴者之饮江海。 知足而已。 孔子犹江海也，赐则奚足以识之。 简子曰善哉子贡之言也。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Zhao Jianzi asked Zi Gong, “How did Confucius conduct himself?”
        Zi Gong said, “I, Ci, cannot know.”
        Vexed, Jian Zi said, “I took you ten years to complete your training in the teachings of Confucius.
        The ruler asks and you reply that you cannot know.  Why?”
        Zi Gong said, “Let me use a metaphor.  It would be like drinking all the rivers and seas to quench one's thirst.
        It is only necessary to be content.
        Confucius is like all the rivers and seas.  As for me, how could I be adequate to understand him?”
        Jian Zi said, “Your words are very virtuous.”

        Zhao Jianzi Raises an Army to Attack Qi (Garden of Stories)
      </h4>
      <p class='example'>
        赵简子举兵而攻齐，令军中敢谏者罪至死。被甲士，名曰公卢，望见简子大笑。简子曰，子何笑。对曰，臣有宿笑。简子曰有以解之则可，无以解之则死。对曰当桑之时，臣邻家夫与俱之田。见桑中女，因往追之，不能得之。还反，其妻怒而去之。臣笑其旷也。简子曰今吾伐国失国，是吾旷也。于是罢师而归。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        Zhao Jianzi raised an army to attack the State of Qi.  He ordered complaining amongst the soldiers to be punished as a crime by execution. 
        An officer wearing armour, named Gong Lu, looked at Jian Zi and laughed wildly.
        Jianzi asked, “Sir, why do you laugh?”
        Facing towards him he said, “You servant spent the whole night laughing.”
        Jian Zi said, “So there is an explanation for it.  There is no other explanation but for you to die.”
        Facing towards him he said, “I was amongst the mulberry trees in the field near the house where my 
        wife and I live.
        Amongst the mulberry trees I saw a woman but, because I was chasing her, I could not catch her.
        Going back, my wife was in a rage and left.”
        Jian Zi said, “Today I attack one state and loose another. It is pointless.
        Therefore, we will stop the campaign and return.”

        The King of Wu Desired to Attack Chu (Garden of Stories)
      </h4>
      <p class='example'>
        吴王欲伐荆，告其左右曰，有敢諌者死。舍人有少孺子者，欲谏不敢，则怀丸操弹，游于后园，露沾其衣。如是者三旦。吴王曰，子来。何苦沾衣如此。对曰，园中有树，其上有蝉。蝉高居悲鸣饮露，不知螳蜋在其后也。螳蜋委身曲附欲取蝉，而不顾知黄雀在其旁也。黄雀延颈欲啄螳蜋，而不知弹丸在其下也。此三者皆务欲得其前利，而不顾其后之有患也。吴王曰善哉乃罢其兵。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        The King of Wu desired to attack Chu and told his retainers and officials that anyone 
        complaining would be executed.
        A palace attendant with a small child wanted to object but did not dare. Rather he held a 
        slingshot with a pellet in on his body and walked to the back garden where his clothes got 
        wet with due.
        So he spent three dawns.
        The King of Wu said, “Sir, please come here.
        What greivance wet your clothes in this way?”
        He said, “In there garden there are some trees with cicadas on them.
        The cicadas live up high and sadly weep, drinking due.  There is a praying mantis 
        back here as well.
        The praying mantis bends its body hoping to catch a cicada in spite of the small bird at 
        its side.
        The small bird stretches its neck wanting to catch the praying mantis not knowing that 
        there is a slingshot pellet below it.
        These three times I have been laboring to take the advantage but each time has ended in 
        failure.”
        The King of Wu said, “Excellent!” He thus dismissed his troups.
