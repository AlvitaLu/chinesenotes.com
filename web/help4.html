    <h3 class='article'>Disambiguating different senses of a Chinese word</h3>
    <p>
       Chinese is a rich language with a long history and this leads to words that have many different 
       meanings.  That is, the same character or combination of characters has different meanings in 
       different contexts.  There are two different cases of this: (a) a <i>homonym</i>, where the words are 
       truly different, and (b) <i>polysemy</i>, where there a multiple related senses of the word.  
       Chinese is a little different from languages, like English, where more-or-less phonetic 
       spellings are used because the same character may have multiple different pronunciations.  
       In fact, 'spelling' does not really apply to Chinese. Determining the correct meaning for a 
       word in a particular sentence or other context is called word-sense disambiguation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post I will describe how to use the <a href='/'>www.chinesenotes.com</a> dictionary 
      to find the different meanings of Chinese words.  Chinese words with the same character(s) 
      may different in traditional forms, pronunciation, sense, and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at an example, the character <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a> (pinyin: shì), which is one of the most common words in 
      Chinese that most often means 'is.'  There are six different  meanings found for this character, 
      as shown in the screenshot below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class='picture'>
        <a href='illustrations_use.php?mediumResolution=screenshot_word_sense.png'><img 
           class='use' src='images/screenshot_word_sense.png' 
            alt='Word-sense disambiguation for <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a>' 
            title='Word-sense disambiguation for <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a>'/></a>
            <div class='caption'>Word-sense disambiguation for <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a></div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The character is entered into the search text field (1, in red) and the Search button clicked, 
      showing the results below.  The simplified and traditional characters are shown (2, 3).  
      In this case both simplified and traditional are the same but there are often differences 
      with the same simplified character mapping to different traditional characters.  
      An example is the character <a title='tái | measure word for electrical appliances, such as computers, televisions, etc' href='/words/821.html'>台</a> (pinyin: tái).  This simplified character is equivalent to 
      the traditional characters <a title='tái | measure word for electrical appliances, such as computers, televisions, etc' href='/words/821.html'>台</a>, <a title='tái | measure word for electrical appliances, such as computers, televisions, etc' href='/words/821.html'>臺</a>, <a title='tái | desk / platform / terrace' href='/words/8302.html'>檯</a>, <a title='tái | measure word for electrical appliances, such as computers, televisions, etc' href='/words/821.html'>臺</a>,<a title='tái | typhoon' href='/words/8304.html'>颱</a>, depending on the context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mandarin pronunciation is shown under the Pinyin column (4).  Again, this example has the same 
      pronunciation for each meaning but this is not always the case.  The character <a title='xíng | capable / competent' href='/words/1259.html'>行</a> has the possible 
      pronunciations xíng, háng, hàng, and hèng, again, depending on context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English translation of the word is given under the English column (5).  
      The different English words separated by '/' (6) represent different approximations to the same 
      meaning of the Chinese word.  There is not often a one-to-one relationship between Chinese and 
      English words so usually several English words are given.  This also aids in translation by 
      providing the translator with a few choices.  Different lines represent different words.  
      For example, the first meaning of <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a> is 'is' and the second means 'is precisely.'  
      These are different but related senses.  An example, of the first may be: <a title='nǐhǎo | hello' href='/words/4088.html'>你好</a>，<a title='wǒ | I / me / my' href='/words/321.html'>我</a><a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a><a title='Wáng | Wang' href='/words/3235.html'>王</a>。(Hello, 
      I am Wang).  An example of the second may be: A: <a title='wǒ | I / me / my' href='/words/321.html'>我</a><a title='juéde | to think / to feel' href='/words/7456.html'>觉得</a><a title='nǐ | you' href='/words/4081.html'>你</a><a title='nǐ | you' href='/words/4081.html'>你</a><a title='bù shì | no / is not / not' href='/words/8537.html'>不是</a><a title='Wáng | Wang' href='/words/3235.html'>王</a>。(I don't think that you are Wang.)  
      B: <a title='wǒ | I / me / my' href='/words/321.html'>我</a><a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a><a title='Wáng | Wang' href='/words/3235.html'>王</a>。(I am Wang.)  If we look at a good Chinese-Chinese dictionary you will probably find 
      about twenty different entries for <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a>.  However, many of them are even more closely related than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grammatical function of the word under the column Grammar (7) can more information to help 
      disambiguate the word.  For example, the forth sense of <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a> is a pronoun, meaning 'this' or 'that.'  
      Clearly, this is a totally different meaning.  If click on the simplified Chinese text them the 
      detailed information for that meaning shows that it is a classical Chinese word.  In fact, 
      it was not until the modern Chinese era that <a title='shì | is / are / am / to be' href='/words/277.html'>是</a> had the meaning 'is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, there are notes (8) to help explain and differentiate the different meanings and senses.
