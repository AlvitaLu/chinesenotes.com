        Han Feizi
      </h3>
      <p>
        Han Feizi 韩非子 or just Han Fei 韩非 (c. 280—233 BCE) was pre-Han
        dynasty philosopher best known for being one of the developers of the
        Legalist school of philosophy 法家. Han Feizi was born into the ruling
        aristocracy of the state of Han near the end of the Warring States
        Period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legalism was one of the four principle schools of thought in the
        Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods. The other three schools
        were Confusianism 儒家, Mohism 墨家, and Daoism 道家. In Legalism the
        ruler controls the state with the three principles of position 势 of
        power, certain techniques 术, and laws 法. The philosophy distrusts
        human nature and focuses on methods to control people. Legalism was very
        influential to Qin Shi Huang 秦始皇, the first emperor of the
        Qin Dynasty, known for his ruthless unification campaign and systematic
        regulation of writing, and weights and measures.

        The He Clan's Jade Disk
      </h4>
      <p class='example'>
        楚人和氏得玉璞楚山中，奉而献之厉王。厉王使玉人相之，玉人曰石也。王以和为诳而刖其左足。及厉王薨，武王即位，和又奉其璞而献之武王。武王使玉人相之，又曰石也。王又以和为诳而刖其右足。武王薨，文王即位，和乃抱其璞而哭于楚山之下三日三夜，泪尽而继之以血。王闻之使人问其故，曰天下之刖者多矣，子奚哭之悲也。和曰，吾非悲刖也，悲夫，宝玉而题之以石，贞士而名之以诳，此吾所以悲也。王乃使玉人理其璞而得宝焉，遂命曰和氏之璧。
      </p>
      <p class='example'>
        A man from the state of Chu from the He clan, obtained a piece of uncut jade in the Chu Hills. 
        He brought it back as an offering to present to King Li. 
        King Li asked a jade carver to examine it.  The jade carver said, 
        “It is just an ordinary rock.”
        The king cut off He's left foot for decieving him.
        Upon the death of King Li King Wu ascended the throne and, once again, 
        He presented his offering of the uncut piece jade, this time to King Wu. 
        King Wu asked the jade carver to examine it.  Once again the jade carver said, 
        “It is just an ordinary rock.”
        The king cut off He's right foot for being deceitful again.
        When King Wu died and King Wen ascended the throne, He carried the uncut piece of jade to Chu Hills.
        He cried for three days and nights until his tears were exhausted and his tears turned to 
        blood. 
        The king sent men, who asked, “There are many people in the world with their feet cut off.  
        Sir, why do you cry so bitterly?”
        He said, “I am not crying for the loss of my feet but for the false evaluation of this precious jade as an ordinary rock and for being branded as a liar. That is what I am upset about.”
        So the king had the jade carver work the uncut jade and thereupon called it the “Jade Tablet of the He Clan.”
