        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        When learning modern Chinese there is good motivation for studying some of the basics of 
        literary Chinese.  
        The similarities are surprising and the differences interesting as well.
        Native English speakers may wonder about 
        the relevance of this when making an analogy of modern English to Old English
        or perhaps modern Italian to Latin.  
        Perhaps because written Chinese can be read independently of pronunciation it has survived
        in such a recognizable form for so long and been used over a very broad geographic
        area, including all of East Asia.
        In fact, literary Chinese is far more commonly encountered
        in China than Old English or Latin is encountered in the West since it is used commonly in
        idioms, quotes, and place names.
        Due to the common set of characters, literary Chinese can be embedded in modern Chinese as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When studying Chinese history,
        literature, and philosophy it is common to study original texts, of which are many and, in contrast
        to Old English and Latin, have a continuous tradition from the beginning of writing in China 
        until the transition from classical Chinese to modern Chinese.  Idioms are much more
        commonly encountered in modern Chinese than modern English and these mostly have their roots
        in classical Chinese.  The many calligraphic works decorating Chinese buildings are invariably
        classical poems.  Literary Chinese is encountered in Buddhist
        texts, whose original translations from Sanskrit are still in wide use today in the 
        Chinese Buddhist community.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series of web pages was written to be a gentle introduction for learners with minimal
        background in modern Chinese or even none at all. You can mouse over any of the 
        Chinese text to find the English
        and Pinyin for the Chinese and follow a hyperlink to additional details.
        Where there are multiple definitions for a given word the mouseover and link will be for
        the right alternative for the given context, especially where the classical use differs from 
        the modern use.
      </p>

        Historical Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first known forms of Chinese writings were written on animal bones
        in a style known as oracle bone script <span title='甲骨文' data-wordid='2595' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>甲骨文</span> in the Shang Dynasty <span title='商' data-wordid='1142,1143,1144,36976' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>商</span>
        (1700 to 1045 BCE).  In the Zhou Dynasty <span title='周' data-wordid='435,17054,37004,37005,37006,37007,37008,37009,37010,37011,37012' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>周</span> (1045—221 BCE) there were
        inscriptions on bronze vessels.  The very early Chinese classics
        The Book of Changes or I Ching <span title='易經' data-wordid='17855' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>易經</span>, Book of History <span title='書經' data-wordid='17845' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>書經</span>, and
        Book of Songs <span title='詩經' data-wordid='17075' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>詩經</span> also date from the Zhou Dynasty. These texts are in a
        very early style referred to as Old Chinese <span title='上古漢語' data-wordid='29207' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>上古漢語</span>
        (Norman, 1988, p. 23).
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms Classical Chinese (<span title='古文' data-wordid='3401' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>古文</span>) and Literary Chinese (<span title='文言文' data-wordid='17900' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言文</span> or <span title='文言' data-wordid='16293' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言</span>)
        are often loosely used interchangably. Classical Chinese more properly
        refers to written Chinese from the end of the Spring and Autumn period
        through to the end of the Han Dynasty. (Norman, 1988, p. 83)
        This include the time of Confucius <span title='孔子' data-wordid='7226' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>孔子</span> (c. 551&mdash;479 BCE),
        continues through the Warring States Period <span title='戰國時代' data-wordid='17433' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>戰國時代</span> (475—221 BCE) to
        the Qin Dynasty <span title='秦' data-wordid='4290,4291,17422' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>秦</span>, when China was first unified in 221 BCE.  
        This was the period of the great philosphers, including the founders of
        the schools of Confucianism <span title='儒家' data-wordid='17546' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>儒家</span>, Taoism <span title='道家' data-wordid='17549' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>道家</span>, Legalism <span title='法家' data-wordid='17542' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>法家</span>, and
        Mohism <span title='墨家' data-wordid='17547' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>墨家</span>. After the unification of China in the Qin there was
        convergence in the written language. However, as time went on the
        written form <span title='文言' data-wordid='16293' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言</span> literary Chinese diverged from the spoken form.
        Literary Chinese refers to the style of written Chinese commonly used
        right through to the end of the Qing Dynasty <span title='清' data-wordid='3355,3356,29203,31215' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>清</span>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are considerable regional differences between the styles of
        writing during the classical period, including (1) the continuation of
        a more archaic style, including Zuozhuan <span title='左傳' data-wordid='17095' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>左傳</span> and Book of Historical 
        Narrative <span title='國語' data-wordid='9418,17852' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>國語</span>; (2) a Lu <span title='鲁' data-wordid='3483,3484,3485,17399' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>鲁</span> style, including The Analects of
        Confucius <span title='論語' data-wordid='7228' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>論語</span> and Mencius <span title='孟子' data-wordid='17096' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>孟子</span>; (3) a Chu <span title='楚' data-wordid='8445,8446,8447,8448' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>楚</span> style, including Sorrow at
        Parting <span title='離騷' data-wordid='17856' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>離騷</span> in Songs of Chu <span title='楚辭' data-wordid='17858' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>楚辭</span>; and (4) a style found in
        Zhuang Zi <span title='莊子' data-wordid='9741' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>莊子</span>, Han Feizi <span title='韓非子' data-wordid='17156' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>韓非子</span>, and Xun Zi <span title='荀子' data-wordid='17848' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>荀子</span> that leads towards a
        common standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buddhist texts were brought to China from India and translated from
        Sanskrit and Pali over a period of many hundred years, starting in the
        Han <span title='漢' data-wordid='2644,2645' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>漢</span> (221 BCE—220 CE), continuing through to the Tang <span title='唐' data-wordid='8299,8300,38005,38006,38007,38008' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>唐</span> (618—907 CE).
        Some of these translations are still popular today, for example
        The Sutra on the Eight Realizations of the Great Beings <span title='佛說八大人覺經' data-wordid='3170' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>佛說八大人覺經</span>
        (Nhất Hạnh, 1987) translated by the Buddhist monk An Shi Gao <span title='安世高' data-wordid='17902' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>安世高</span> in
        the Later Han and Heart Sutra <span title='心經' data-wordid='5041' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>心經</span> translated by the Chinese monk
        Xuanzang <span title='玄奘' data-wordid='4068' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>玄奘</span> (602&mdash;664 CE) in the Tang.

        Language Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese is considered a polysyllabic language because most of the
        words in the language have two characters. Literary Chinese is
        considered basically a monosyllabic language. That is most words consist
        of a single character. There are a number of notable exceptions to this,
        however:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bound compounds whose meanings cannot be deduced from either character
          alone. For example, <span title='君子' data-wordid='7821' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>君子</span> 'nobleman'
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollysyllabic loan words from foreign languages, 
          especially many Buddhist terms from Sanskrit, for example,
          a Buddhist monk <span title='沙門' data-wordid='17887,31933' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>沙門</span> and a Buddhist nun <span title='比丘尼' data-wordid='7201' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>比丘尼</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Binomes, which are an intensifying expression that joins together two
          words with similar pronuncation. For example, <span title='崢嶸' data-wordid='17031' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>崢嶸</span>, which describes
          the lofty nature of tall mountains was pronounced dzaeng-yuaeng in
          Middle Chinese.

        <li>
          Polar binomes, which are a form where writers use an opposite or
          similar pair of words to refer to a set or range. For example, <span title='草木' data-wordid='17034' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>草木</span> 
          'grasses and trees' refers to all vegetation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduplication of certain words can expand the meaning of the word on 
          its own.  For example, <span title='年' data-wordid='438,37643,37645,37646,37647,37648,37649,37650,37651,37652' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>年</span> (year) when reduplicated <span title='年年' data-wordid='17028' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>年年</span> means year
          after year. The word <span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737,41232,41233,41234,41235,41236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (person / people) when reduplicated <span title='人人' data-wordid='5912' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人人</span> means
          everybody.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese has a number of affixes and particles, such as
        <span title='了' data-wordid='393,5629,5630,5631,16959,41156' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>了</span>、<span title='過' data-wordid='829,1202,1970,12241,12242,35730,37701' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>過</span>、<span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span>、<span title='得' data-wordid='411,1459,1460,1461,9459,38236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>得</span>.  However, compared with European languages it has 
        relatively few affixes. Classical Chinese has even fewer affixes than
        modern Chinese. Two plural forms that were commonly used from the
        Warring States Period on are <span title='諸' data-wordid='3555,3556,17036,39518' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>諸</span> and <span title='等' data-wordid='1216,1217,1218,17035,18604,30791,41515' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>等</span>.

      <p>
        Spoken Chinese has varied over its history and geographic areas and
        sounds used in previous times can only be reconstructed from fragmentary
        evidence. It is generally divided into three periods: Old Chinese
        (Shang <span title='商' data-wordid='1142,1143,1144,36976' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>商</span> and Zhou <span title='周' data-wordid='435,17054,37004,37005,37006,37007,37008,37009,37010,37011,37012' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>周</span> to Western Han <span title='西漢' data-wordid='17062' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>西漢</span>), Middle Chinese (Eastern Han
        <span title='東漢' data-wordid='17063' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>東漢</span> to Early Tang <span title='初唐' data-wordid='39971' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>初唐</span>), and Mandarin (Tang <span title='唐' data-wordid='8299,8300,38005,38006,38007,38008' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>唐</span> to Qing <span title='清' data-wordid='3355,3356,29203,31215' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>清</span>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the knowledge of Old Chinese comes from analysis of rhymes in
        The Book of Songs <span title='詩經' data-wordid='17075' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>詩經</span> and Erya <span title='爾雅' data-wordid='17861' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>爾雅</span>, the first Chinese dictionary,
        dating to about the third century BCE. In addition, comparisons with
        other languages and loan words from Indo-European languages have been
        used to understand pronunciation of Old Chinese. In addition, many
        radicals are related to the pronunciation of characters.
        Also, the dictionary, Shuo Wen Jie Zi <span title='說文解字' data-wordid='17080' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>說文解字</span> appeared in the Han
        Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge of Middle Chinese is more complete than Old Chinese because
        Chinese scholars of the time compiled rhyming dictionaries, including
        Qieyun <span title='切韻' data-wordid='17860' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>切韻</span> compiled by Lu Fayan <span title='陸法言' data-wordid='17862' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>陸法言</span> in about 600 CE.  The the
        fan qie <span title='反切' data-wordid='17081' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>反切</span> system used in dictionaries, such as Qieyun, each entry
        consisted of two characters to represent the sound of a word.  The
        first character had the same initial sound and the second character had
        the same final sound. Qieyun formed the basis of
        Guangyun dictionary <span title='广韵' data-wordid='17863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>广韵</span> in around 1011 CE after many revisions and 
        additions. The fan qie system was also used in the Kangxi Dictionary
        <span title='康熙字典' data-wordid='17864' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>康熙字典</span> (1716) considered the first modern Chinese dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Middle Chinese had four tones but there were different
        from modern Chinese.  The were level <span title='平' data-wordid='5361,5362,5363' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>平</span>, rising <span title='上' data-wordid='584,585,586,33542,33668,33669,33670,33671,33672,33673,33674,33675,33676,33677,33678,33681,33682,33683,33684,33685,33686,34965,41328,41329,41330,41331,41332,41333,41334' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>上</span>, falling <span title='去' data-wordid='343,27841,27842,27843,27844,27845,27846,27847,27848,27849,27850' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>去</span>, and
        entering <span title='入' data-wordid='916,6739' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>入</span>. Entering tones ended with a p, t, or k. The tones were
        first documented by Shen Yue <span title='沈約' data-wordid='17866' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>沈約</span> in the fifth century CE.
        In the Qieyun dictionaries the tones were represented by small circles
        at the four corners of the characters.

        When we think about the diversity of the modern dialects of Chinese we
        can appreciate the difficulty of understanding pronunciation from the
        various regions of China thoughout the past 2,400 years or so. 
        Nevertheless, classical Chinese is commonly read aloud in modern
        Mandarin, for example in Buddhist chanting. There are eight major modern
        dialects that can be divided into three groups.

        Basic Grammatical Principles
      </h3>
      <p>
        The general rules of word order are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          subject precedes predicate
        </li>
        <li>
          a modifier precedes the word it modifies

        <li>
          a verb precedes its object
        </li>
      </ol>

        Words can shift grammatical function in classical Chinese within certain patterns.  
        Here are a few constant rules to help distinguish grammatical function.

          </p>
          <p>
          However, direct objects can be placed after a negating word and before the verb, which
          can make this rule less obvious to recognize.

          is often used to mark subordination.  Placing it between the subject and verb of a subject-predicate
          phrase turns it into a nominal phrase.

          Most words that we think of as adjectives in English can act as static verbs.  That is
          verbs that describe state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are five types of grammatical relationships: topic-comment, verb-object,
        coordination, subordination, and number complement.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Topic-Comment
          <p>
          This is a variation of the subject-predicate relation but a little
          more broad. The topic is the focus of the phrase and most often is
          placed first. The comment is a statement about the topic. The simplest
          type of topic-comment phrase is a nominal sentence that identifies one
          noun with another. Nominal sentences with the pattern A B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span> most
          frequently mean A is a B or A is a type of B.
          A <span title='猶' data-wordid='7929,7930,7931,17115' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>猶</span>
          B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span>
          (A is like B) is another form of nominal sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Topicalization is the transfer of the usual order of a sentence to
            change the element that is being stressed.  This is an important
            tool in classical Chinese rhetoric. For example, from Zhuang Zi <span title='莊子' data-wordid='9741' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>莊子</span>,
          </p>
          <p>
            <span title='臣' data-wordid='6967,6968' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>臣</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='所' data-wordid='383,1157,1198,17100,17164,32731,39472' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>所</span><span title='好' data-wordid='285,10303,10304,12257,12258,12259,12260,12261,12262,12265,12266,37867' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>好</span><span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span><span title='道' data-wordid='3247,3248,3249,9874,10204,11474,11475,28900,30953,40659,40660,40661,40663,40663,40664,40665,40666,40667,40668' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>道</span><span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span>
            <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
            Topicalization is one type of a broader movement of sentence
            elements to the front called exposure.  Exposure is often used for
            rhetorical emphasis or to mark a contrast.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Verb-Object
          <p>
            The simplest case of a verb-object is a verb and a direct object.
            For example, <span title='飲' data-wordid='4358' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>飲</span><span title='酒' data-wordid='7470' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>酒</span> (to drink wine). Sometimes the object of a verb is
            another verb. For example, <span title='使' data-wordid='832,30854,30855,30857,30858' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>使</span><span title='歸' data-wordid='5606,12225,12226,12227' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>歸</span> (to cause to return).
          </p>
          <p>
            Time and place information usually expressed through prepositional
            phrases in English and modern Chinese are expressed using 
            verb-object relations in classical Chinese. The time and place words
            are locative objects of verbs. For example, <span title='居' data-wordid='767,768,878' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>居</span><span title='山' data-wordid='3122,3718,6794' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>山</span><span title='中' data-wordid='332,2485,5138,13814,32951,37936' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>中</span> (to live in the
            mountains). Sometimes the locative particle <span title='於' data-wordid='1710,17116,17918,33166,33167,33169,33170,33171,33172,33173,33174,33175,33176,33178' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>於</span> will be used. However,
            some references classify <span title='於' data-wordid='1710,17116,17918,33166,33167,33169,33170,33171,33172,33173,33174,33175,33176,33178' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>於</span> as a preposition in the context of
            literary Chinese.
          </p>
          <p>
            Auxiliary verbs are used in a similar way to modern Chinese.
            Frequently used auxiliary verbs are <span title='應' data-wordid='1242,1243,17212,42647,42648,42649' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>應</span>， <span title='能' data-wordid='1263,12946,12947,39462,39463,39464' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>能</span>， <span title='必' data-wordid='2270,17118' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>必</span>， <span title='肯' data-wordid='9442,17119' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>肯</span>， <span title='須' data-wordid='4497,13532,17878' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>須</span>. 
            For example, <span title='應' data-wordid='1242,1243,17212,42647,42648,42649' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>應</span><span title='歸' data-wordid='5606,12225,12226,12227' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>歸</span> (should return).           
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinate Relationships
          <p>
            In a coordinate relationship two terms of the same type are used
            together. The elements may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
            adverbs, or phrases. The conjunctions <span title='與' data-wordid='509,1956,1957,17903,39470,42243,42244,42245,42246' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>與</span>， <span title='且' data-wordid='2256,17121,17750' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>且</span>， <span title='而' data-wordid='1336,6960,37610,37611,37612,37613,37614,37615,37616,37617,37618,37619,37620' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>而</span>， <span title='或' data-wordid='2027,2028,17181' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>或</span>， and <span title='將' data-wordid='1317,1318,1319,3717,17123,37677,37678,39471,39502' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>將</span> are
            frequently used to join terms in a coordinate 
            relationship. However, conjunctions are also often omitted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Subordinate Relations
          <p>
            In a subordinate relation the first element modifies the second. The
            first element is the modifier and the second element is 
            called the head. For example, <span title='青' data-wordid='483,4310,36092,38241' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>青</span><span title='草' data-wordid='3980,3981,3982' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>草</span> green (modifier ) grass (head).
            The elements of a subordinate relation can be nouns, 
            verbs, or phrases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span> is a marker for explicit subordination to a noun. It turns a
            verbal phrase into a nominal phrase. For example, 
            <span title='日出' data-wordid='17366' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>日出</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='陽' data-wordid='3192,3193,3194,16504' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>陽</span> (the sun at sunrise, from <span title='說苑' data-wordid='17362' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>說苑</span> Garden of Stories). 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Number Complements
          <p>
            A number complement relation has the form (number) + (measure). Here
            the measure is a noun that is a measure of some kind of 
            quantity. For example, <span title='二' data-wordid='302,6735,33457' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>二</span><span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737,41232,41233,41234,41235,41236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (two people). Measure words, as found in
            modern Chinese, originated from this form.
          </p>

      <p>
        Punctuation in classical Chinese has mostly been added at a later date
        to make reading easier. In particular, question marks, quotation marks,
        and semi-colons were not used at all in literary Chinese.  Some literary
        Chinese text used no punctation at all, making it very difficult for
        modern readers. Some texts used periods in place of both periods and
        modern commas. This web page uses basic periods and commas in order to
        make text a little more readable but avoids more modern additions like
        question marks, quotation marks, and semi-colons.
