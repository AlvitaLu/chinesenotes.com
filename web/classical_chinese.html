        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        When learning modern Chinese there is good motivation for studying some of the basics of 
        literary Chinese.  
        The similarities are surprising and the differences interesting as well.
        Native English speakers may wonder about 
        the relevance of this when making an analogy of modern English to Old English
        or perhaps modern Italian to Latin.  
        Perhaps because written Chinese can be read independently of pronunciation it has survived
        in such a recognizable form for so long and been used over a very broad geographic
        area, including all of East Asia.
        In fact, literary Chinese is far more commonly encountered
        in China than Old English or Latin is encountered in the West since it is used commonly in
        idioms, quotes, and place names.
        Due to the common set of characters, literary Chinese can be embedded in modern Chinese as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When studying Chinese history,
        literature, and philosophy it is common to study original texts, of which are many and, in contrast
        to Old English and Latin, have a continuous tradition from the beginning of writing in China 
        until the transition from classical Chinese to modern Chinese.  Idioms are much more
        commonly encountered in modern Chinese than modern English and these mostly have their roots
        in classical Chinese.  The many calligraphic works decorating Chinese buildings are invariably
        classical poems.  Literary Chinese is encountered in Buddhist
        texts, whose original translations from Sanskrit are still in wide use today in the 
        Chinese Buddhist community.
      </p>
      <p>
        This series of web pages was written to be a gentle introduction for learners with minimal
        background in modern Chinese or even none at all. You can mouse over any of the 
        Chinese text to find the English
        and Pinyin for the Chinese and follow a hyperlink to additional details.
        Where there are multiple definitions for a given word the mouseover and link will be for
        the right alternative for the given context, especially where the classical use differs from 
        the modern use.

        Historical Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first known forms of Chinese writings were written on animal bones
        in a style known as oracle bone script <span title='甲骨文' data-wordid='2595' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>甲骨文</span> in the Shang Dynasty <span title='商' data-wordid='1142,1143,1144,36976' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>商</span>
        (1700 to 1045 BCE).  In the Zhou Dynasty <span title='周' data-wordid='435,17054,37004,37005,37006,37007,37008,37009,37010,37011,37012' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>周</span> (1045—221 BCE) there were
        inscriptions on bronze vessels.  The very early Chinese classics
        The Book of Changes or I Ching <span title='易经' data-wordid='17855' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>易经</span>, Book of History <span title='书经' data-wordid='17845' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>书经</span>, and
        Book of Songs <span title='诗经' data-wordid='17075' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>诗经</span> also date from the Zhou Dynasty. These texts are in a
        very early style referred to as Old Chinese <span title='上古汉语' data-wordid='29207' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>上古汉语</span>
        (Norman, 1988, p. 23).
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms Classical Chinese (<span title='古文' data-wordid='3401' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>古文</span>) and Literary Chinese (<span title='文言文' data-wordid='17900' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言文</span> or <span title='文言' data-wordid='16293' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言</span>)
        are often loosely used interchangably. Classical Chinese more properly
        refers to written Chinese from the end of the Spring and Autumn period
        through to the end of the Han Dynasty. (Norman, 1988, p. 83)
        This include the time of Confucius <span title='孔子' data-wordid='7226' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>孔子</span> (c. 551&mdash;479 BCE),
        continues through the Warring States Period <span title='战国时代' data-wordid='17433' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>战国时代</span> (475—221 BCE) to
        the Qin Dynasty <span title='秦' data-wordid='4290,4291,17422' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>秦</span>, when China was first unified in 221 BCE.  
        This was the period of the great philosphers, including the founders of
        the schools of Confucianism <span title='儒家' data-wordid='17546' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>儒家</span>, Taoism <span title='道家' data-wordid='17549' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>道家</span>, Legalism <span title='法家' data-wordid='17542' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>法家</span>, and
        Mohism <span title='墨家' data-wordid='17547' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>墨家</span>. After the unification of China in the Qin there was
        convergence in the written language. However, as time went on the
        written form <span title='文言' data-wordid='16293' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>文言</span> literary Chinese diverged from the spoken form.
        Literary Chinese refers to the style of written Chinese commonly used
        right through to the end of the Qing Dynasty <span title='清' data-wordid='3355,3356,29203,31215' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>清</span>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are considerable regional differences between the styles of
        writing during the classical period, including (1) the continuation of
        a more archaic style, including Zuozhuan <span title='左传' data-wordid='17095' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>左传</span> and Book of Historical 
        Narrative <span title='国语' data-wordid='9418,17852' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>国语</span>; (2) a Lu <span title='鲁' data-wordid='3483,3484,3485,17399' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>鲁</span> style, including The Analects of
        Confucius <span title='论语' data-wordid='7228' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>论语</span> and Mencius <span title='孟子' data-wordid='17096' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>孟子</span>; (3) a Chu <span title='楚' data-wordid='8445,8446,8447,8448' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>楚</span> style, including Sorrow at
        Parting <span title='离骚' data-wordid='17856' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>离骚</span> in <span title='楚辞' data-wordid='17858' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>楚辞</span>
        Songs of Chu; and (4) a style found in <span title='庄子' data-wordid='9741' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>庄子</span>
        Zhuang Zi, <span title='韩非子' data-wordid='17156' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>韩非子</span>
        Han Feizi, and <span title='荀子' data-wordid='17848' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>荀子</span>
        Xun Zi that leads towards a common standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buddhist texts were brought to China from India and translated from
        Sanskrit and Pali over a period of many hundred years, starting in the
        Han <span title='汉' data-wordid='2644,2645' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>汉</span> (221 BCE—220 CE), continuing through to the Tang <span title='唐' data-wordid='8299,8300,38005,38006,38007,38008' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>唐</span> (618—907 CE).
        Some of these translations are still popular today, for example
        The Sutra on the Eight Realizations of the Great Beings <span title='佛说八大人觉经' data-wordid='3170' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>佛说八大人觉经</span>
        (Nhất Hạnh, 1987) translated by the Buddhist monk An Shi Gao <span title='安世高' data-wordid='17902' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>安世高</span> in
        the Later Han and Heart Sutra <span title='心经' data-wordid='5041' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>心经</span> translated by the Chinese monk
        Xuanzang <span title='玄奘' data-wordid='4068' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>玄奘</span> (602&mdash;664 CE) in the Tang.

        Language Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese is considered a polysyllabic language because most of the words in the 
        language have two characters.  
        Classical Chinese is considered basically a monosyllabic language.  
        That is most words consist of a single character. There are a number of notable
        exceptions to this, however:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bound compounds whose meanings cannot be deduced from either character alone.
          For example, <span title='君子' data-wordid='7821' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>君子</span>
          nobleman
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollysyllabic loan words from foreign languages, 
          especially many Buddhist terms from Sanskrit, for example,
          a Buddhist monk <span title='沙门' data-wordid='17887,31933' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>沙门</span> and a Buddhist nun <span title='比丘尼' data-wordid='7201' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>比丘尼</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Binomes, which are an intensifying expression that joins together two words with similar pronuncation.
          For example, <span title='峥嵘' data-wordid='17031' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>峥嵘</span>, which describes the lofty nature of tall mountains was
          pronounced dzaeng-yuaeng in Middle Chinese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Polar binomes, which are a form where writers use an opposite or similar pair of words to refer to a set 
          or range. For example, <span title='草木' data-wordid='17034' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>草木</span> 'grasses and trees' refers to all vegetation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduplication of certain words can expand the meaning of the word on its own.  For example, <span title='年' data-wordid='438,37643,37645,37646,37647,37648,37649,37650,37651,37652' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>年</span>
          (year) when reduplicated <span title='年年' data-wordid='17028' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>年年</span> means year after year.
          The word <span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (person / people) when reduplicated <span title='人人' data-wordid='5912' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人人</span> means everybody.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Modern Chinese has a number of affixes and particles, such as <span title='了' data-wordid='393,5629,5630,5631,16959' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>了</span>、<span title='过' data-wordid='829,1202,1970,12241,12242,35730,37701' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>过</span>、<span title='者' data-wordid='671,17149,17165,38111,38112,38113' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>者</span>、<span title='得' data-wordid='411,1459,1460,1461,9459,38236' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>得</span>.  However, compared with European languages it has 
        relatively few affixes. 
        Classical Chinese has even fewer affixes than modern Chinese.  
        Two plural forms that were commonly used from the Warring States Period on are <span title='诸' data-wordid='3555,3556,17036,39518' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>诸</span> and <span title='等' data-wordid='1216,1217,1218,17035,18604,30791' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>等</span>.

      <p>
        Spoken Chinese has varied over its history and geographic areas and sounds used in 
        previous times can only be reconstructed from fragmentary evidence.  
        It is generally divided into three periods: Old Chinese
        (Shang <span title='商' data-wordid='1142,1143,1144,36976' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>商</span> and Zhou <span title='周' data-wordid='435,17054,37004,37005,37006,37007,37008,37009,37010,37011,37012' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>周</span> to Western Han <span title='西汉' data-wordid='17062' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>西汉</span>), 
        Middle Chinese (Eastern Han <span title='东汉' data-wordid='17063' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>东汉</span> to Early Tang <span title='初唐' data-wordid='39971' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>初唐</span>), and
        Mandarin (Tang <span title='唐' data-wordid='8299,8300,38005,38006,38007,38008' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>唐</span> to Qing <span title='清' data-wordid='3355,3356,29203,31215' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>清</span>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the knowledge of Old Chinese comes from analysis of rhymes in
        The Book of Songs <span title='诗经' data-wordid='17075' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>诗经</span> and Erya <span title='尔雅' data-wordid='17861' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>尔雅</span>, the first Chinese dictionary,
        dating to about the third century BCE. In addition, comparisons with
        other languages and loan words from Indo-European languages have been
        used to understand pronunciation of Old Chinese. In addition, many
        radicals are related to the pronunciation of characters.
        Also, the dictionary, Shuo Wen Jie Zi <span title='说文解字' data-wordid='17080' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>说文解字</span> appeared in the Han Dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge of Middle Chinese is more complete than Old Chinese because
        Chinese scholars of the time compiled rhyming dictionaries, including
        Qieyun <span title='切韵' data-wordid='17860' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>切韵</span> compiled by Lu Fayan <span title='陆法言' data-wordid='17862' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>陆法言</span> in about 600 CE.  The the
        fan qie <span title='反切' data-wordid='17081' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>反切</span> system used in dictionaries, such as Qieyun, each entry
        consisted of two characters to represent the sound of a word.  The
        first character had the same initial sound and the second character had
        the same final sound. Qieyun formed the basis of
        Guangyun dictionary <span title='广韵' data-wordid='17863' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>广韵</span> in around 1011 CE after many revisions and additions.
        The fan qie system was also used in the Kangxi Dictionary <span title='康熙字典' data-wordid='17864' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>康熙字典</span> (1716)
        considered the first modern Chinese dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Middle Chinese had four tones but there were different
        from modern Chinese.  The were level <span title='平' data-wordid='5361,5362,5363' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>平</span>, rising <span title='上' data-wordid='584,585,586,33542,33668,33669,33670,33671,33672,33673,33674,33675,33676,33677,33678,33681,33682,33683,33684,33685,33686,34965' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>上</span>, falling <span title='去' data-wordid='343,27841,27842,27843,27844,27845,27846,27847,27848,27849,27850' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>去</span>, and
        entering <span title='入' data-wordid='916,6739' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>入</span>. Entering tones ended with a p, t, or k. The tones were
        first documented by Shen Yue <span title='沈约' data-wordid='17866' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>沈约</span> in the fifth century CE.
        In the Qieyun dictionaries the tones were represented by small circles at the four 
        corners of the characters.

      <p>
        When we think about the diversity of the modern dialects of Chinese we can appreciate the
        difficulty of understanding pronunciation from the various regions of China thoughout the
        past 2,400 years or so.  Nevertheless, classical Chinese is commonly read aloud in modern
        Mandarin, for example in Buddhist chanting.
        There are eight major modern dialects that can be divided into three groups.

        Basic Grammatical Principles
      </h3>
      <p>
        The general rules of word order are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          subject precedes predicate
        </li>
        <li>
          a modifier precedes the word it modifies
        </li>
        <li>
          a verb precedes its object
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Words can shift grammatical function in classical Chinese within certain patterns.  
        Here are a few constant rules to help distinguish grammatical function.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
          Nouns are negated by <span title='非' data-wordid='1003,7045,12024,12025,33285,33286,33289,33291,33293,33294,33296,33297,33298,33299,33300,33301' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>非</span>，<span title='无' data-wordid='1843,6844,13465,33159,33162,33163,33164,33165,39490' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>无</span>.

          (From the Book of Songs)
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
          However, direct objects can be placed after a negating word and before the verb, which
          can make this rule less obvious to recognize.
          </p>
          <p>
            The topic is often omitted when it is understood.

          A verbal construction must follow <span title='所' data-wordid='383,1157,1198,17100,17164,32731,39472' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>所</span>.

          is often used to mark subordination.  Placing it between the subject and verb of a subject-predicate
          phrase turns it into a nominal phrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most words that we think of as adjectives in English can act as static verbs.  That is
          verbs that describe state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are five types of grammatical relationships: topic-comment, verb-object,
        coordination, subordination, and number complement.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Topic-Comment
          <p>
          This is a variation of the subject-predicate relation but a little more broad.  
          The topic is the focus of the phrase and most often is placed first.
          The comment is a statement about the topic. The simplest type of 
          topic-comment phrase is a nominal sentence that identifies one noun with another.
          Nominal sentences with the pattern A B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span> most frequently mean A is a B or A is a type of B.
          A <span title='犹' data-wordid='7929,7930,7931,17115' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>犹</span>
          B <span title='也' data-wordid='925,8853' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>也</span>
          (A is like B) is another form of nominal sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Topicalization is the transfer of the usual order of a sentence to change the element
            that is being stressed.  This is an important tool in classical Chinese rhetoric.
            For example, from <span title='庄子' data-wordid='9741' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>庄子</span>

            <span title='臣' data-wordid='6967,6968' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>臣</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span><span title='好' data-wordid='285,10303,10304,12257,12258,12259,12260,12261,12262,12265,12266,37867' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>好</span>

            Topicalization is one type of a broader movement of sentence elements to the front called
            exposure.  Exposure is often used for rhetorical emphasis or to mark a contrast.

        <li>
          Verb-Object
          <p>
            The simplest case of a verb-object is a verb and a direct object.  For example, <span title='饮' data-wordid='4358' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>饮</span><span title='酒' data-wordid='7470' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>酒</span> (to drink wine). 
            Sometimes the object of a verb is another verb. For example, <span title='使' data-wordid='832,30854,30855,30857,30858' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>使</span><span title='归' data-wordid='5606,12225,12226,12227' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>归</span> (to cause to return).
          </p>
          <p>
            Time and place information usually expressed through prepositional phrases in English and modern Chinese are expressed using 
            verb-object relations in classical Chinese. The time and place words are locative objects of verbs. For example, <span title='居' data-wordid='767,768,878' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>居</span><span title='山' data-wordid='3122,3718,6794' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>山</span> 
            (to live in the mountains). Sometimes the locative particle <span title='于' data-wordid='1710,17116,17918,33038,33166,33167,33169,33170,33171,33172,33173,33174,33175,33176,33178' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>于</span> will be used. However, some references classify <span title='于' data-wordid='1710,17116,17918,33038,33166,33167,33169,33170,33171,33172,33173,33174,33175,33176,33178' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>于</span> as 
            a preposition in the context of classical Chinese.
          </p>
          <p>
            Auxiliary verbs are used in a similar way to modern Chinese. Frequently used auxiliary verbs are <span title='应' data-wordid='1242,1243,17212' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>应</span>， <span title='能' data-wordid='1263,12946,12947,39462,39463,39464' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>能</span>， <span title='必' data-wordid='2270,17118' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>必</span>， <span title='肯' data-wordid='9442,17119' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>肯</span>， <span title='须' data-wordid='4497,4498,13532,17878' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>须</span>. 
            For example, <span title='应' data-wordid='1242,1243,17212' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>应</span><span title='归' data-wordid='5606,12225,12226,12227' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>归</span> (should return).           
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinate Relationships
          <p>
            In a coordinate relationship two terms of the same type are used together. The elements may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
            adverbs, or phrases. The conjunctions <span title='与' data-wordid='509,1956,1957,17903,39470' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>与</span>， <span title='且' data-wordid='2256,17121,17750' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>且</span>， <span title='而' data-wordid='1336,6960,37610,37611,37612,37613,37614,37615,37616,37617,37618,37619,37620' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>而</span>， <span title='或' data-wordid='2027,2028,17181' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>或</span>， and <span title='将' data-wordid='1317,1318,1319,3717,17123,37677,37678,39471,39502' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>将</span> are frequently used to join terms in a coordinate 
            relationship. For example, <span title='我' data-wordid='321,32344' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>我</span><span title='与' data-wordid='509,1956,1957,17903,39470' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>与</span> (you and I). However, conjunctions are also often omitted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Subordinate Relations
          <p>
            In a subordinate relation the first element modifies the second. The first element is the modifier and the second element is 
            called the head. For example, <span title='青' data-wordid='483,4310,36092,38241' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>青</span><span title='草' data-wordid='3980,3981,3982' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>草</span> green (modifier ) grass (head). The elements of a subordinate relation can be nouns, 
            verbs, or phrases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span> is a marker for explicit subordination to a noun. It turns a verbal phrase into a nominal phrase. For example, 
            <span title='日出' data-wordid='17366' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>日出</span><span title='之' data-wordid='730,13788,17936,30898,33281' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>之</span> (the sun at sunrise, from <span title='说苑' data-wordid='17362' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>说苑</span> Garden of Stories). 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Number Complements
          <p>
            A number complement relation has the form (number) + (measure). Here the measure is a noun that is a measure of some kind of 
            quantity. For example, <span title='二' data-wordid='302,6735,33457' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>二</span><span title='人' data-wordid='399,6737' class='dict-entry' data-toggle='popover'>人</span> (two people). Measure words, as found in modern Chinese, originated from this form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Punctuation in classical Chinese has mostly been added at a later date to make reading easier.  
        In particular, question marks, quotation marks, and semi-colons were not used at all in classical 
        Chinese.  Some classical Chinese text used no punctation at all, making it very difficult for
        modern readers. Some texts used periods in place of both periods and modern commas.
        This article uses basic periods and commas in order to make text a little more readable but
        avoids more modern additions like question marks, quotation marks, and semi-colons.
